<h3><a name="THE_RAJAHS_HEIR" id="THE_RAJAHS_HEIR">THE RAJAH'S HEIR</a></h3>

<h4>PROLOGUE</h4>


<p>'A dream and a forgetting. Is our life that?
The sages who have searched into the past and
future say that it is even so. A dream&mdash;another
dream; a beginning&mdash;an ending; a beginning
again&mdash;an ending again; in all the world no
halt for the trembling spirit until the dizzy
height be reached. And that&mdash;when will it be?
I accept not the priceless boon alone. Ye Holy
Ones, who have been my companions from my
boyhood, whose wills have wrought upon my
will, whose bodiless voices have counselled me,
ye know what is in my heart. If I had separated
myself from my kind, from the children
who depend upon me for their daily bread, I
might now have attained to the goal of my
spiritual desire; instead of going forth upon
this weary flight I might have been basking in
the light of knowledge, as the Divine&mdash;nay, the
very Divine myself. But it cannot be. For
their sakes I must begin again.'</p>

<p>Slowly and brokenly the words fell upon the
silence. He who spoke them&mdash;a man but a few
hours ago in the full pride and glory of life&mdash;was
dying. Early that morning he had gone
out as was his wont from his palace, he had
ridden over fields which he had redeemed from
the wilderness, he had visited the fair markets
that his munificence had opened; he had gone
on foot, as he had often done before, through
the crowded streets of the city he governed,
when the hand of an assassin struck him down.
The blow was dealt before the eyes of the loyal
throngs that pressed round their rajah; yet the
miscreant who did the foul deed made no effort
to escape.</p>

<p>'He is a Feringhee,' he muttered as (the
wounded prince having forbidden violence) the
people led the assassin to prison. 'He is a
Feringhee. He will take away from us our
religion and customs, and give us foreigners to
rule over us.'</p>

<p>Weeping and moaning, the attendants of the
rajah had dressed his wound with such cool
unguents as they could procure on the instant,
and, while some carried him to his palace, others
went in hot haste for the European doctor at
the Residency. He let them do what they would,
knowing that the doing would ease their pain;
but, for himself, he was well aware that the end
of his life, as master of these good people and
lord of loyal Gumilcund, had come.</p>

<p>When everything that skill and care could
devise had been done he begged his attendants
to leave him. He wished to be alone.</p>

<p>He had been brought back to his palace at
mid-day, and now the evening was drawing on.
The golden light of the westering sun stole in
through perforated marble lattices, and lay in
patches on the white pavement, and made the
water that flowed tinkling through, a trough in
the centre of the apartment shine like rubies
and sapphires. The Arabian carpet on which,
propped up with cushions, the rajah lay, had
been drawn by his request close to this trough,
and his long brown fingers played aimlessly with
the water. As he lay, his lower limbs covered
with shawls of the richest Oriental workmanship,
and the upper part of his body wrapped in a
padded cloak of silk embroideries, exhausted as
he was with suffering, the peculiar dignity and
beauty of his appearance must have struck
anyone who saw him for the first time. It was
a grand face, finely wrought, noble in form
and expression. Those who looked upon it
loved it.</p>

<p>The jewelled turban, which he was never
more to wear, lay beside the rajah on his pillow,
and close at hand was a lacquered tray, containing
a gold cup, an alabaster casket, and a silver
bell.</p>

<p>The words given above, only a few out of
many, were spoken aloud. The effort of thinking
was too great for the strength so swiftly
ebbing away. Smiling sadly, the rajah put out
his hand for the gold cup. He reached it, but
he could not raise it to his lips, whereupon he
touched the silver bell. While the sound was
still vibrating through the air, one of the many
dusky forms that were thronging the doorway
stood before him.</p>

<p>'Hoosanee,' he said, 'call Chunder Singh.'</p>

<p>Swift and silent as the shadow that sweeps
across a ripe corn-field were the feet of the
servant. But he had not far to go. In less
than a minute a man, slender, but of commanding
stature, dressed in snowy white, and wearing
a red turban, stood, with head humbly bowed
and eyes so dim with tears that he could scarcely
see, before the rajah.</p>

<p>'My master wants me at last,' he said, an
accent of reproach in his voice.</p>

<p>'I am tired. Give me to drink,' said the rajah.</p>

<p>Chunder Singh raised his head and put the
golden cup to his lips. He drank, and the
death-like languor left his eyes. 'That is
enough. I am stronger,' he said.</p>

<p>'I would it were the elixir of life,' murmured
Chunder Singh, who was weeping bitterly.</p>

<p>'Your words bring back the past,' said the
rajah, his lips parting in a sad smile. 'The
Elixir of Life! Long ago, when we were boys
together, how diligently we sought for it,
Chunder, poring over the ancient Arabic manuscripts!
We were to drink of it and live, age
after age, age after age. We were to bring our
grey experience to the use and service of the
nations. We were to mould a new world,
where righteousness would be the law and
happiness&mdash;happiness, instead of misery&mdash;the
common lot.'</p>

<p>He paused. 'Dreams!' said Chunder Singh.
'Yet I wish now that they might return.'</p>

<p>'Dreams!' echoed the rajah. 'We know&mdash;you
and I&mdash;that we are deathless. What need
of elixirs for us? Though I seem to die&mdash;though
to-morrow you will take out this body
and burn it&mdash;the chain of existence has not run
out to its limit. <i>I</i> remain.'</p>

<p>'But not with us&mdash;not with us!' cried
Chunder Singh, flinging himself down with his
face to the marble pavement.</p>

<p>He was aroused from his paroxysm of grief
by the voice of the rajah. 'You are mistaken.
Rise and sit beside me, and I will tell you what
will make your heart leap with joy.'</p>

<p>Then Chunder Singh rose and dried his eyes,
and the rajah spoke. 'There was a moment
when I thought that this death would be my
last; that when I left the prison of this mortal
body I should go forth into the liberty of unconditioned
existence; for I have lived as a
sage. By day and by night, at the ordered
hours, I have meditated upon the sacred books.
I have conquered appetite and passion, and
have worked for the sake of others, looking not
for reward. Is this true, Chunder Singh?'</p>

<p>'It is true, my lord.'</p>

<p>'I know that it is true, and I know that the
door into the highest heaven stands open. But,'
in a low and broken voice, 'I may not enter in.'</p>

<p>'Why will my lord say so?'</p>

<p>'I say what I know, what the Invisible Ones
have revealed to me. It is two years now since
they spoke to me of this. "Brother," they
said, "the door stands open. Enter in." I
bowed down with my face to the ground. "And
my people," I said, "they will enter in with
me?" "Nay," said the Holy Ones; "have they
lived as you have done?" And I said, "They
will." And the Holy Ones answered, "Who
will teach them when you have gone? There is
no communion between gods and men." Then
I trembled, and my knees smote together.
"There will rise up others," I said, "like-minded
with us; and these will teach them." And they
said, "So it may be; yet who knoweth aught
of that which is to come?" "Promise me,"
I said, "that they shall be led into the path
that I have trodden." But to my prayer no
answer was vouchsafed. After that, Brother
Chunder, many days went by. Morning, noon,
and night I thought of my people, humbly beseeching
the Invisible Ones to grant me the
assurance of their final emancipation; but the
heavens were as brass over my head, and my
words as empty air. But one night, when I was
musing, I heard a voice that I had never heard
before. "Sacrifice," it said, "is the salt of devotion."
As I pondered what this might mean
there fell upon me suddenly great awe, and a
horror of darkness enveloped me. More days and
nights passed over me, and then I spoke again.
"It is enough," I said, "I will return again to
the dark forest of conditioned existence, and my
people shall live." Then at last the Invisible
Ones spoke clearly. "So be it," they said.
"For your brothers' sakes you shall go through
another incarnation, and a body is ready."'</p>

<p>Here Chunder Singh trembled.</p>

<p>'Be still,' said the rajah, laying a long brown
hand upon his arm. 'Hear me to the end; for
I have still stranger things to tell. Across the
sea, in the land from which my father's father
came, there lives a youth, to whom I desire to
send you. He thinks himself wholly of the
West; but our blood runs in his veins. Into
him it is decreed that I shall enter, that, through
him, I may return to my people and city.
Listen, Brother Chunder, and consider carefully
what I shall say to you. When these eyes are
closed, and you have carried out this body to
the burning, you must go to the land where my
father's father lived; you must find that youth
of our race; you must be faithful to him as you
have been faithful to me.'</p>

<p>'But how shall I know him when I see him?'
said Chunder Singh.</p>

<p>'You will know him by this, that he is my
heir. My last will and testament is in England,
in the hands of our agent, with whom you have
often communicated by letter. He, if you present
the credentials that I leave with you, will
give you all the information you require. Understand,
Chunder, while the youth is in England,
amongst the friends of his boyhood, I do
not desire that you shall press yourself upon
him. When he has&mdash;as I know he will&mdash;made
up his mind to become one of us, then you will
wait upon and help him. Will you?'</p>

<p>'My lord, thou knowest,' cried the poor
fellow, weeping. 'Of what value is Chunder's
life to him now, save as he can carry out the
wishes of his master?'</p>

<p>The rajah smiled. 'That is well,' he said,
'I am satisfied. This,' laying his hand on the
alabaster casket, 'I give to you. It contains
gold and English notes, and my secret instructions.
Strike the bell three times!'</p>

<p>Chunder Singh obeyed. On the instant the
marble pavement round the rajah's couch was
thronged with the figures of men in white and
coloured garments, whose weeping and lamentation
filled the air of the apartment.</p>

<p>But when the rajah lifted his hand there
was silence. Then every one of them fell down
with their faces to the ground. In a voice that
faltered with weakness he bade them rise and
listen to his last words. They obeyed him
trembling. 'Listen, my children!' he said.
'It is the will of the Supreme, who doeth as He
listeth in the heavens above and in the earth
beneath, that I should leave you for a season;
but when the times are fulfilled I will return.
Until I come the elders of the city, Chunder
Singh and Lutfullah and the others'&mdash;he looked
smilingly from one to another&mdash;'will rule you
under the English Resident, whom I have seen
to-day, and to whom you will refer in case of
difficulty. I call you all to witness that to my
faithful minister, Chunder Singh, I give this
casket with everything it contains. Hoosanee,
my bearer, will take the gold cup out of which
I drink, and the diamond star in my turban.
To him and all of you there are legacies of which
you will hear in the proper time and place.
It is my desire that the palace be kept as it is
till your lord's return. The treasury is in the
hands of the Resident, and he will give you your
pay. My faithful servants, farewell! Thank
you for your service. I can say no more. As
you love me, I beseech you to withdraw quietly.'</p>

<p>Stifled sobs followed the rajah's words, but
not a single word was spoken. One by one,
with lingering looks of love, they left the apartment.
At last there were none left but Chunder
Singh, his foster-brother, and Hoosanee, his
bearer. He looked with yearning affection from
one to the other, said feebly, 'Chunder will tell
my Hoosanee,' and fell back dead.</p>

<h5><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a></h5>

<h4>THE HEIR</h4>


<p>In a little green box by the banks of the silver
Thames, far from the busy haunts of men and
commerce, yet near enough to a busy little
county town not to be altogether cut off from
the society of their fellows, there lived at the
time of the death of the Rajah of Gumilcund,
known amongst his Indian contemporaries as
Byrajee Pirtha Raj, a widow and her son. They
were English. The widow was of middle age.
She had been handsome, and she was still comely
and pleasant to look upon. The son had just
turned his twenty-first year.</p>

<p>The two were somewhat of an enigma to
their neighbours, one of whom&mdash;the well-known
Lady Winter&mdash;used to say that the good folks
of Surbiton and Kingston ought to be thankful
to the Gregorys, without whose eccentricities
they would not have had anything to talk about.</p>

<p>Now, it was very well that Mrs. Gregory did
not hear this kind speech, for, however she may
have affected her neighbours, it is very certain
that she had not the least desire to be eccentric.
And indeed the peculiarity which set all these
busy tongues wagging had more to do with her
son than with herself. His appearance, to begin
with&mdash;how did he come to be so curiously, so
abnormally, different from his mother? No one
seeing them together could have imagined that
they were closely related. She was one of those
large, fair women&mdash;placid in temper and gentle
in manner&mdash;who develop naturally out of the
lily-white blonde of poetry and romance when
she is foolish enough to step across the boundary
that divides youth from middle age. He had
the lithe figure, the olive skin, and the dark
melting eyes that are supposed to belong to the
great southern races.</p>

<p>The observant said there was something
more. They said that the boy's expression of
face divided him more completely from his
mother than its colour and form. I am speaking
now of his childish years. They say&mdash;I did
not myself know him in these days&mdash;that there
was a wonderful stillness, a curious, unchildlike
spirituality about him; that he looked now and
then as if his little soul were in the presence of
visions which made the things of earth strange
to him. This was noticed once to his mother by
a garrulous neighbour, and the anger with which
she received the remark was remembered long
after in the neighbourhood. As a fact, the poor
woman, placid as she seemed, had her own
strongly-marked ideals. When her infant was
born, and she called him Tom&mdash;a name which
the neighbours said did not suit him in the
least&mdash;she had visions of him in the future as
a fair-haired, white-skinned Anglo-Saxon athlete,
a cricketing and footballing hero, winning the
plaudits of the crowd and provoking the envy
of meaner mortals by his magnificent feats.
Nature, however, had other views for the lad.
But of this we shall see more hereafter. In the
meantime it must be mentioned that the curious
difference between the mother and son was not
their only peculiarity. It was whispered that
there was something strange&mdash;and we all know
how much may lurk behind those two little
words&mdash;in their past history. That Mrs. Gregory
had spent several of her early years in India,
where her grandfather, Sir Anthony Bracebridge,
had been one of those fine old Anglo-Indian
officers who by their military dash and political
genius laid the foundation of the vast English
empire that was then slowly growing up in the
East; that her father had in his turn entered
the service of the East India Company and
won distinction; and that her husband, Captain
Gregory, had belonged to the same order, and
had been killed in one of the little wars about
which no one in England knew anything;&mdash;so
much everyone had heard, and this, it might
have been thought, was sufficient for the most
exacting of neighbourhoods. And no one, doubtless,
would have asked for any more but for Mrs.
Gregory's curious reticence with regard to the
past.</p>

<p>She was naturally an expansive and garrulous
woman. Everyone knew that. She was
not in the least like Lady Winter, for instance,
who measured her words carefully. She loved
talking and kissing, and the genial company of
intimate friends. Dearest Tom, and his little
smart sayings, the house, the servants, the tradespeople,
her own and other people's ailments;
she was ready at any time to discuss these with
effusion. But let one of her acquaintances touch
upon India or her early years, and her lips were
sealed immediately. So marked was this, that,
curious as some of her neighbours were&mdash;and
those were the days when India was, to the
generality of people, a land of romance and
mystery&mdash;it was tacitly agreed that it should
not be mentioned before her, and so by degrees
the gossip died down. Mrs. Gregory was an
excellent neighbour and a genial companion.
She had a pretty cottage, a good-looking, dutiful
son, and she gave charming tea-parties. The
neighbourhood accepted her and let her past
alone. The coming of General Sir Wilfrid Elton
and his family to Surbiton set tongues wagging
again. Some one found out that the Eltons
and Bracebridges were friends of old standing.
Some one else suspected that Mrs. Gregory had
not been particularly pleased when she heard
they meant to settle near her, and two or three
of the sensationally disposed looked forward to
what they were pleased to call 'revelations.'
None, however, came. The General was far too
busy a person to gossip. Lady Elton, a pretty,
timid, domestic woman, took to no one in the
neighbourhood but Mrs. Gregory; and the girls
either knew nothing, or had no inclination to
tell what they knew. Our story dates from the
summer of the Eltons' visit to Surbiton.</p>

<p>Tom Gregory, who was then just of age, had,
in one respect, fulfilled the promise of his childhood.
He was a handsome man for all that his
beauty was not of that Anglo-Saxon type which
was so dear to his mother's heart. An artist
who met him one autumn day wandering by the
riverside just as dusk had fallen, described himself
as startled by his beauty. He attended one
of Lady Winter's receptions later, and asked her
in the presence of Miss Vivien Leigh, her pretty
and eccentric niece, who the young Greek god
of the river was. Her ladyship lifted up her
eyebrows and wondered what upon earth he
could mean. But Vivien smiled. 'He's met
Tom Gregory in his boating flannels, aunt,' she
said, in her light airy voice, which seemed always
to have a ring of mockery in it. 'And do you
know I think I shall keep the illustration; it's a
remarkably good one. Which god, Mr. Walters&mdash;Apollo
or Mars?'</p>

<p>'Scarcely Mars&mdash;not fierce enough; but the
warlike element might develop. Educate him,
Miss Vivien.'</p>

<p>'Mr. Walters,' said Lady Winter, holding up
her finger reprovingly, 'my niece is quite naughty
enough. She doesn't want any stimulating.'</p>

<p>I give this little scrap of gossip to show the
effect which Tom produced in those days on some
of the most stylish of his contemporaries. But
although, not altogether, it must be confessed,
to his mother's approbation, Tom had kept his
remarkable appearance, he had changed in many
ways from the beautiful boy who had woven
golden visions in the garden by the river. He
had been educated, and educated well. Acting
on the advice of her friends, and chiefly of old
Mr. Cherry, legal adviser of the Bracebridges for
three generations, Mrs. Gregory had sent him first
to a good preparatory school, then to Eton, and
lastly to the University of Oxford, where he had
just finished his term with credit. It was the
general opinion that this elaborate and costly
training, which was supposed to have eaten largely
into Mrs. Gregory's slender resources, had been
thrown away upon Tom, who declined to belong
either to the church, the bar, or the army&mdash;the
only professions which were in those days considered
admissible for a gentleman. But Mrs.
Gregory was satisfied. 'It has made an Englishman
of him,' she said.</p>

<p>This was a little puzzling to the friend to
whom the remark had been made. 'Why
Englishman?' she said; 'he was English before.'</p>

<p>'I ought to have said "gentleman,"' she answered;
'but, to my mind, the one includes the
other.' She was certainly no fool, this fair,
placid-faced widow.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, to be an Englishman, or even
an English gentleman, is not remunerative as a
profession, and it having been constantly impressed
upon Tom that, if he were ever to live in
that atmosphere of refinement which is supposed
to belong to a gentleman's condition, he
must make money, it became necessary for him
to cast about for some means of doing so.</p>

<p>He pondered for several weeks, visiting
London two or three times in the interval. All
this time he said nothing to his mother, and she,
knowing his temperament, would not urge him
to speak.</p>

<p>Then one evening he asked formally if he
might have a little conversation with her, and
she knew, by the light in his face, that he had
come to a decision.</p>

<p>'Well,' she said, smiling, 'what is it to be?
Will you take Mr. Cherry's advice and be a
lawyer? He will help you, I know, for the sake
of "Auld Lang Syne."'</p>

<p>'So he was kind enough to say,' answered
Tom. 'But I thanked him and said "No." I
should make a poor lawyer. I want something
practical to do. If I were a rich man I should
enter the diplomatic service. As I am poor, I
wish to make myself an architect.'</p>

<p>'An architect!' cried his mother, wondering
within herself what possible connection there
could be between the two professions. 'A
builder of houses, do you mean?'</p>

<p>'Houses, churches, cathedrals, playhouses,
anything I may be put to,' said Tom, smiling at
his mother's look of dismay. 'You see there is
something permanently useful about building&mdash;always
supposing that you build well&mdash;and it
leaves the other half of the mind free.'</p>

<p>'The other half! What in the world do you
mean, Tom?'</p>

<p>'I don't know that I am very clear about it
myself, mother. But I think it will be good for
me to have my fingers and the constructive side
of my intelligence occupied.'</p>

<p>Of course Mrs. Gregory argued the point.
She had never heard of a Bracebridge being an
architect. Even the Gregorys, so far as she
could learn, had always belonged either to the
army or to one of the clerical professions.
Were architects gentlemen? Did they take a
place in society? Could they make money?</p>

<p>Her son quoted one or two great names out
of ancient and modern history; but these did
not satisfy her in the least. When he continued
to urge his views she begged for time to consult
their friends; but Tom would not hear of it.</p>

<p>'No, mother,' he said, 'this is a question for
you and me, no one else. Can you put down
the money'&mdash;he mentioned a comparatively small
sum&mdash;'which will be necessary to bind me as
an apprentice, and will you undertake to keep
me for the next two years?'</p>

<p>'As to keeping you,' said the poor woman,
tears filling her eyes, 'I should do that under
any circumstances. What have I to live for but
you? But&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Then, dearest mother, let us settle it so.
In any case I shall not be losing my time.
Every art acquired is an additional power and
resource. If I find I am mistaken, if I wish to
take up what you think a loftier walk of life, I
can always do it; and, in the meantime, we are
together.'</p>

<p>Yes, they were together, that was the great
sweetener of everything; and she was not one
to do battle for ideal excellence, or to stand firm
against well-sustained importunity. 'After all it
is you, not I, who are choosing a profession,' she
said feebly. 'And&mdash;and&mdash;you are not quite
like others. If things come to the worst&mdash;&mdash;'
And here she broke off and set her lips together,
as if she had a secret to guard.</p>

<p>'If things come to the worst,' said Tom, who
was accustomed to these little breaks, and did
not mind them, 'we should manage to battle it
out somehow, little mother. I am not in the
least afraid.'</p>

<p>They arrived at this decision early in the
spring. It was then that General Sir Wilfrid
Elton, who was at home on a year's furlough
from India, paid a visit to his old friend Mrs.
Gregory, and fell in love with the cottage adjoining
hers that had been empty since the
previous summer. She was very frank in
pointing out its deficiencies: the tumbledown
condition of the fences and outhouses, the close
neighbourhood of the river, the likelihood of
damp. 'It would be pleasant to have neighbours,'
she said wistfully, 'but I should be
sorry for such old friends as Lady Elton and
you to do anything so important with your eyes
shut.'</p>

<p>'We shall certainly not do that,' said the
General, with his hearty laugh.</p>

<p>'But consider the girls!' said Mrs. Gregory,
a pink flush mounting to her face&mdash;the General
was such a curiously quizzical man. 'This is a
dull place for young people.'</p>

<p>'Dull!' echoed the General, clapping his
hand to his knee. 'You have spoken the word.
The good people in London have tired us out
with festivities. Since we came home it has
been one rush. Lady Elton is beginning to be
sick of it, so am I. As for the girls, they must
make the best of it. Two or three months of
eclipse in holland frocks and brown straw
hats will do the little monkeys all the good in
the world.'</p>

<p>Of course there was nothing more to be said.
Mrs. Gregory smiled sweetly, and with a tremor
at her heart, and an unuttered hope that if Lady
Elton and the General knew more about her
former life than her neighbours&mdash;a circumstance
concerning which she could not be perfectly
sure&mdash;they would be discreet, entered, with the
enthusiasm of a friend, and the practical ability
of an experienced housekeeper, into the arrangements
necessary to make the new <i>ménage</i> comfortable.
As a fact the Eltons proved most
delightful neighbours. Lady Elton and Mrs.
Gregory struck up a friendship which, while it
had the charm of novelty, drew much of its
sweetness from the past. The girls, who were
not little schoolmisses, as might have been imagined
from their father's reference to holland
frocks and straw hats, but young women ranging
from twenty-two to seventeen, flashed in and out
of the widow's rooms, dragged her off with them
for picnics on the river, and filled up her somewhat
barren days with the overflowings of their
exuberant life. As for the General, who had
become a great gardener in his retirement, he
looked in upon his neighbour, as a general rule,
once a day, to inquire after her health, and discuss
the condition of their respective crops of
roses and strawberries. Tom meanwhile came
and went, going to town early in the morning and
returning home in the evening. To the surprise of
everybody he seemed to like the life. He showed
a curious enthusiasm about his work, which he
would call neither a business nor a profession,
but an art. The evenings and the whole of
Saturday and Sunday were his own property;
and then he would doff his city clothes and put
on the flannels that became him so well, and
either spin himself up and down the river in his
outrigger, to the admiration of the Elton girls, or
dream on his mothers lawn, or take tea, a little
primly, but withal satisfactorily, in their neighbour's
charming rose-garden, whither his mother
and Lady Winter, and Sir Reginald her son, and
that pretty enigma, Vivien Leigh, would come;
and sometimes after these tea-parties he would
find himself strolling along the river with one
of the girls&mdash;occasionally Grace Elton, oftener
Vivien Leigh&mdash;while the ringing voices of the
rest of their little party sounded behind them;
until the sunlight faded, and the little stars
twinkled out in the pale zenith.</p>

<p>And so we come to that memorable day in
June, from which, as Tom was accustomed to
say later, everything dated.</p>

<p>It was that loveliest moment of all the English
year, when summer, which has been coquetting
for weeks with the enamoured earth, breaking
out one day into sunny smiles, and on the next
hiding her sweet face in mists and clouds, has
issued forth at last in her full beauty. In the
irresistible magic of her presence the meadows
had become gemmed with flowers; the beeches
and elms, and even the tardy old oaks, which are
of too ancient a lineage to be beguiled by mere
promises, lifted up golden-green canopies to the
heavens; the birds&mdash;nightingales and larks, and
linnets and thrushes&mdash;made the copses and hedgerows
resonant with joyful music. For three
whole days the sky and the river had been penetrated
with sunlight.</p>

<p>In weather such as this Tom Gregory spent
as little time as possible in town. On the particular
day which I am trying to recall he found,
to his contentment, that there was not much
doing, and he gained permission easily from the
head clerk of his department to leave earlier
than usual.</p>

<p>His mother was out when he reached the
cottage&mdash;at Lady Elton's, the servant said. Proposing
to himself to join her there a little later,
he ran up to his room, threw off his city dress,
put on his flannels and went out into the garden.</p>

<p>There was a certain tree at its further end, a
weeping-ash with long pendent branches, under
whose shadow it was often his pleasure to hide
and dream. He would take out a volume of
poetry&mdash;Shelley and Coleridge were his favourites&mdash;and
lying on his stomach, with his head
propped on his elbows, would read a few stanzas,
just, as he would express it, to set himself going.
After that, if he had nothing particular to think
out, he would give a free rein to his fancy, which
would range over heaven and earth with the
unbridled, glorious luxuriance of youth. Meantime
he would watch the waters as they flowed
past his retreat, taking absent note of the procession
of boats and the laughing music of young
voices, which blended sweetly with the sighing of
the wind and the chanting of the birds.</p>

<p>This evening, as he remembered later, he had
taken out Coleridge. The volume opened of its
own accord at that magnificent fragment, 'Kubla
Khan.' He read it over twice, with that curious
rapture of satisfaction which nothing but the
greatest poetry can call out; and then the mystic
imagery in its stately setting of miraculously
beautiful words set his mind wandering on a
wild vision quest of its own.</p>

<p>What the vision was, or whether he was bold
enough to imagine that <i>he</i> could build</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 11.5em;">That dome in air&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice&mdash;</span><br />
</p>

<p>I must not venture to say, lest I should suddenly
find myself, 'like little wanton boys that swim
on bladders,' floundering in depths whither few
will care to follow me.</p>

<p>The dream lasted for an hour, and the boy
came to himself with a start, for an image, which
he did not in the least wish to detain, was haunting
him. He sprang up, gave himself a shake
like a dog after a swim, and went slowly towards
the boat-house, murmuring, as he walked, the
words which had called up the unwelcome
image&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A savage place! as holy and enchanted</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">By woman wailing for her demon lover!</span><br />
</p>

<p>'I wonder why that always makes me think
of Vivien Leigh,' he said to himself with a perplexed
smile. 'I couldn't imagine her wailing
for any one, least of all a lover, demon or human.
Perhaps it's because she's a little inhuman herself.
I'm sure she would have been put down
as a witch in the middle ages.' He began to
whistle a lively air to put Vivien out of his head.
Then her image was expelled by another.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Her face resigned to bliss or bale&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Her face, oh call it fair not pale,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And both blue eyes more bright than clear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Each about to have a tear.</span><br />
</p>

<p>'What a contrast!' he said to himself, as he
stooped over his boat to loosen the painter.
'<i>She</i> is human&mdash;exquisitely, beautifully human.'</p>

<p>At this moment he heard his mother calling
him, and, tying up his boat again, he went out
of the boat-house and on to the lawn.</p>

<p>'Tom, Tom! where are you?' She looked
flushed and excited and out of breath.</p>

<p>'Here I am, mother!' he said. 'I thought
you were at the Eltons. I was just going to
take my boat round and see if any one was in.
You look tired, dear. Come and sit down by
the river.'</p>

<p>'Oh, dear! I have had such a hunt for you,'
she said. 'I went in to the Eltons after lunch
to get them to show me a new stitch, and the
girls and their father were out; he has gone to
town, for a wonder. So Lady Elton and I sat
chatting about old days, forgetting altogether
how the time went, and then I came in to see
about your supper, and Sarah told me you had
been in an hour.'</p>

<p>'An hour or thereabouts, and I was just
going out for a stretch. Can it be time for
supper already?'</p>

<p>'No, not quite; but&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>And here she pulled up, for she perceived to
her annoyance that Tom was not listening to
her.</p>

<p>'Do you hear me, Tom?' she said. 'The
post has just come in, and there is a letter&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>The boy held up his hand beseechingly.
'One moment, mother!' he pleaded. 'The
letter will keep and that will not.'</p>

<p>Now Mrs. Gregory did not agree with him in
the least; as a fact, she had come out to find
him, being moved with an irresistible feeling of
curiosity concerning the contents of his letter,
which was of an unusual character, and addressed
in an unusual hand. Tom had very few
correspondents, and his mother generally knew
from whom his letters came by merely glancing
at them. But she knew from experience that
Tom was not to be forced. Pliant as he seemed,
there was a certain backbone of stubbornness
about him. So, keeping herself in check as well
as she could, she looked out at the sight 'which
would not keep.' It was certainly a pretty picture.
Anybody would have been bound to confess
that. A pleasure-boat full of young girls,
gliding softly along a broad tranquil stream;
their light garments and brown and golden hair
steeped in the rosy evening light. Of course it
was pretty. Mrs. Gregory, who liked and admired
the 'dear girls,' from beautiful Grace, the
eldest, down to mischievous, tiresome, delightful
Trixy, the privileged baby of the two establishments,
thought it not only pretty but interesting.
There was nothing new, however, nothing to
provoke that irritatingly intense look on her
son's face and delay the gratification of her
curiosity.</p>

<p>But Tom! Ah! 'alchemy of youth and passion;
how it transforms everything it touches!'
To him not Cleopatra in her barge of state,
floating proudly down her river to the strains of
spirit quelling music, was so beautiful.</p>

<p>There were no less than five girls in the boat.
Two of them had been rowing, and, as the impetus
given by their last vigorous strokes carried
it along, they leaned forward on their oars, gazing
dreamily into the shadows; the third, a little
golden-haired creature, lay in the bows with her
face towards the water, and two sat in the stern&mdash;one,
a royal-looking girl, whose tense expression,
direct gaze, and upright attitude showed that
she liked the post of directress steering; the other,
a much softer, and, at the same time, a lovelier
woman, sitting back with hands folded, and
singing in a rich low voice a beautiful old English
ballad.</p>

<p>As long as the voice could be heard and the
boat seen the boy on the river bank looked out
and listened. Presently the air carried the
sounds away, and the outlines of the boat were
lost in the shadows of the willows that fringed
the opposite bank. Then he turned to his
mother.</p>

<p>'Only the Eltons,' she said. 'I thought,
from the way you called out, I was going to see
something wonderful. My dear boy, for pity's
sake, don't look so intense!'</p>

<p>'I am afraid I can't help my looks,' said Tom
a little stiffly. 'Shall we go back to the house?
It is getting damp here. You will be having
your rheumatism again.'</p>

<p>'Yes, discretion is the better part of valour,'
said Mrs. Gregory. 'Give me your arm, Tom.
I am not so young as I was once. You know,
dear'&mdash;apologetically&mdash;'you mustn't mind what
I say about your looks. To me it is just the
same, though, of course, I don't <i>like</i> to see you
dreamy and romantic, for I know to what these
things tend. I was so once myself.'</p>

<p>'And it hasn't brought you to any great
harm, little mother.'</p>

<p>'I don't know that, Tom. However, I am a
woman, and I had friends to look after me&mdash;not
that they always&mdash;but that is neither here nor
there. You, my poor dear, <i>know</i> what is before
you. A man in your position, with his way to
make in the world, must keep all his wits about
him, or he will soon find himself nowhere.'</p>

<p>'A country about which I have always been
rather curious,' said Tom, to whom these admonitions
were not new. 'How if I tried a little
wool-gathering, just to have a look in?'</p>

<p>'Oh, well, you may laugh; but you will
remember my words some day, and I only hope
it may not be too late for your own comfort.
And now, perhaps, you will take your letter.'</p>

<p>'A letter for me!' said Tom. 'Why'&mdash;scrutinising
it&mdash;'this looks important&mdash;blue
paper, black seal!'</p>

<p>'I thought it rather funny myself,' said Mrs.
Gregory. 'But don't stare at it, child! Open
and read it!'</p>

<p>'Come inside first,' said Tom.</p>

<p>They went through a pretty little verandah,
well furnished with plants, into Mrs. Gregory's
drawing-room, which, though very far indeed
from the daintily-æsthetic apartment that ladies
haunt now, was pleasant and comfortable&mdash;well
supplied with books in handsome bindings
and fine engravings, and furnished with a low
couch, an ottoman, and several lounging-chairs.
Into one of these Tom plunged, and, having
thrown down his boating-cap on the table,
broke the seal of his letter. His mother, who
was watching him curiously, saw his face flush
red. Then she knew that there was something
in his letter which surprised him. It seemed to
her at that moment as if all the blood in her
body were rushing to her heart, which bounded
as if it would burst. The next thing she knew
Tom was looking at her, with the strangest
expression in his face.</p>

<p>'Did you know of this, mother?' he said.</p>

<p>'Know of what?' she cried. 'Oh, Tom!
Tom! what is it? Something has happened!'</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said; and she fancied now that
there was a curious, unusual glitter in his
eyes. 'Something has happened.'</p>

<p>She caught at his arm. 'It is something
dreadful. I am sure of it from your face.'</p>

<p>'Dreadful!' echoed the boy, breaking into
a laugh which rang unnaturally in his mother's
ears. 'I think few people would call it so.'</p>

<p>'But what is it? Oh, Tom!' besought the
poor woman, as her son turned his soft meditative
eyes upon her. 'Speak at once, and don't
look at me in that way. Child! child! It is
like a dream come to life again. I can't bear it.
Tom, I say! Speak to me. God help me! He
hasn't looked so since he was a baby.'</p>

<p>It was Tom's turn to look surprised. 'My
dear mother,' he said soothingly, 'what is the
matter? I am afraid I have been frightening
you. It is very stupid of me; but the news in
this letter is so extraordinary&mdash;so unexpected.
I have read over the principal part of it twice,
and I feel still as if I must be dreaming. But
Mr. Cherry is a man of business; he would not
be likely to make a mistake.'</p>

<p>'Mr. Cherry! Is the letter from him?'</p>

<p>'Yes; he tells me he is the agent and
solicitor&mdash;&mdash;Mother, what is it?'</p>

<p>'Nothing, dear, nothing&mdash;only you are
telling the story rather slowly. Mr. Cherry,
you say&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Perhaps you had better read the letter
yourself, mother. I can't say I understand it
quite.'</p>

<p>'Yes, give it to me! Quick! I hear the
General coming up the garden. My dear boy,
don't look like that before him&mdash;don't, for pity's
sake!'</p>

<p>As she spoke she seized the letter, glanced
over its contents, put her hands before her eyes
as if the lamplight dazzled her, read it again,
and then, with a cry of mingled joy and sorrow,
flung herself into her son's arms.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h5><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h5>

<h4>GENERAL SIR WILFRID ELTON</h4>


<p>The General was an intimate friend, who never
waited to be announced. He would come up
through the garden, examining its condition
critically, with a view to a report for Mrs.
Gregory's benefit, and, frequently, her gardener's
confusion. Then he would poke about the
verandah, where, on these fine evenings, his
neighbour was often to be found, and, failing
that, he would look into the drawing-room. If
Mrs. Gregory was not there, he would make up
his mind that she was either dressing, eating, or
visiting; and, keeping a careful mental note of
the particulars he had intended to report, would
return to his family.</p>

<p>The General was a man of whose friendship
anyone might have been proud. Simple as he
was in his speech and manner, it was well known,
even in Surbiton, that, in his own line, he was a
brilliant and distinguished person. Though no
longer young, he was a fine man&mdash;a soldier every
inch of him&mdash;not tall, but spare and muscular.
His hair was plentifully sprinkled with grey;
his face was bronzed by years of exposure to
weather; his light blue eyes looked at you
keenly and steadily from beneath finely pencilled
brows that gave an air of refinement to
the face; and his mouth, for all that it was half
hidden by a grey moustache, had, in its lines,
an expression of firmness and self-dependence
which would have won him respect anywhere.
The most superficial observer saw at once that
the General, debonair as he might be in his
manners, was not a person to be trifled with.
This evening he came up the garden, as he was
accustomed to do, but rather more rapidly than
usual, and neglecting to take notes.</p>

<p>He was actually in the verandah when Mrs.
Gregory threw herself into her son's arms; and,
had not Tom seen him and begged him to come
in, he would certainly have retreated.</p>

<p>'I fear I am intruding,' he said, as Mrs.
Gregory, who looked curiously shaken, turned
to greet him. 'Just like me. Lady Elton said
to me, "Much better wait;" but we are such
intimate friends; besides&mdash;why, Mrs. Gregory,
my good old friend, you have borne so much
bad fortune with resolution, you are surely not
going to break down when good fortune comes
knocking at your door? She's a jade we don't
generally find it difficult to welcome. Tom, my
boy, I congratulate you. No more building
now&mdash;eh! You'll be giving orders instead of
taking them&mdash;a very different sort of business.
You look surprised&mdash;only just know yourselves?
Well, curiously enough, it got wind at the club&mdash;how,
heaven only knows. I believe that
rumours have wings. I was interested, of
course, having known all the family so well,
and I called in at Mr. Cherry's on my way home
to ask him if there was any foundation for the
rumour.'</p>

<p>'And he told you it was true?' said Mrs.
Gregory.</p>

<p>'Yes, he was civil enough to answer my
questions. The rajah's will, he says, will be
public property to-morrow, so it is no breach of
confidence.'</p>

<p>As he spoke he had settled himself in an
armchair and put his cane and wide-brimmed
straw hat on the floor beside him. 'Now, really,'
he said, looking from mother to son, 'you are
the very funniest people I ever met. I expected
to find my young friend Tom dancing a war-dance.
Why, young man, do you know what it
means to be rich?'</p>

<p>'I think I do, General.'</p>

<p>'Oh! do you? Then all I can say is, wait
till you see. It means a good many things, my
boy, that you can't so much as guess at. But
come, Mrs. Gregory, you can't feel it so much!
How many years is it since you met your cousin,
the rajah?'</p>

<p>'I am really afraid to think,' said Mrs.
Gregory, rousing herself with an effort. 'Still,
a death is a death, and it was so unexpected.'</p>

<p>'You were in correspondence with the
rajah?'</p>

<p>'Oh no! And that's what makes it so
strange. I might have thought&mdash;expected&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Just so. You might have expected to be
remembered.'</p>

<p>'I don't know why,' said the poor woman,
with a wan smile. 'But, of course, there was
the relationship. Very distant, as you know.
My poor father and the late rajah of Gumilcund's
father were only half-brothers. If it hadn't
been for the infatuation of my grandfather, Sir
Anthony&mdash;but I am giving you ancient history&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'On the contrary, you are interesting me
very much. Sir Anthony was always staunch
to his Indian connections.'</p>

<p>'Yes; I wondered myself that he married a
second time.'</p>

<p>'Oh! he was bound to have an English heir,
said the General, smiling, 'a determination to
which you may be said to owe your existence.
But about this fortune, are there any particulars?
Your cousin, the rajah, you know, is said to have
been phenomenally rich. I heard something of
it when I was in India last, and, if I hadn't been
so busy, I should have got the resident Montgomery
to have me invited. A discovery was
made in the state the other day&mdash;a ruby mine&mdash;think
of that! I suppose it is Tom's now. They
say the city is a perfect little model. The rajah
was reviving lost arts and setting a new civilisation
going. Will Tom be expected to take the
supervision of it all?'</p>

<p>'Oh, no, no! There are absolutely <i>no</i> conditions.
Mr. Cherry says so expressly,' cried
Mrs. Gregory.</p>

<p>'So much the better,' said the General. 'But
most probably the state will lapse to the Company.
What is the matter, Tom? Are you
waking up at last?'</p>

<p>'I don't know,' said the boy. 'It is, of course,
a little bewildering, especially as I know nothing
whatever of the family history of which you and
my mother have been talking. But this I do
know. If I take up this responsibility I will
carry it through to the best of my ability.'</p>

<p>'But there is no responsibility,' said Mrs.
Gregory, wringing her hands. 'General, my
old friend, tell the boy so. He needn't surely
become an Indian rajah because a rajah has left
him a fortune.'</p>

<p>'Of course he needn't,' said the General
lightly; 'though, really, do you know'&mdash;looking
at him&mdash;'I think he would play the part pretty
well. Tom, take your mother's advice. She
has ten times more common sense than you have.
But'&mdash;rising with reluctance&mdash;'I must be going.
Supper? No, thank you. Uncommonly good smell,
though. We have cold meat. It's always cold
meat here. Those young monkeys of mine have
such confoundedly good appetites. Did you see
them on the river, by-the-bye? Look well, don't
they, in their boating get-up?'</p>

<p>'Very well indeed, General. Grace looks as
well again since she came down here,' said Mrs.
Gregory. 'And Trixy ought to be strong. The
liveliness of that child&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Keeps you awake, does she?' said the
General, stroking his iron-grey moustache and
looking out before him with a flash of satisfaction
in his keen blue eyes. 'Tell you what,
ma'am, that child has the courage and wit of the
family. She is a splendid little creature. You
see how she'll come out if ever she's tried! And
that reminds me&mdash;the little witch has persuaded
me to let her go back with us this winter.'</p>

<p>'Oh, General!'</p>

<p>'It is very weak I know, but, positively, I
can't help it. You see, I am taking out the other
four, and it seems hard to leave her behind, poor
monkey.'</p>

<p>'Yes; but five girls in India!'</p>

<p>'You may well exclaim. I consider that the
responsibilities of a rajah's wealth are nothing to
mine. Fortunately they are as good as gold, and
then, you know, I am not like a griff: I know
the ropes, and can make them pretty comfortable.
That new bungalow of mine at Meerut
will be in first-rate order by this, and I mean to
send them up to Nainee Tal in the heats. Well,
I must really be trotting. I am carver, you
know, and I shall be scolded as it is. Come and
see my wife and the girls when you are a little
resigned and can talk it over calmly.'</p>

<p>He was talking when he crossed the verandah,
and when he left off talking he whistled a lively
air and then sang lustily an old barrack-song of
his juvenile days, which brought him to his own
garden gate. He had no sooner opened it than
he was fallen upon by a troop of girls with light
garments and flowing hair. He flourished his
cane and made a feint of trying to escape, but
they took the cane from him, wound their arms
about him and held him fast. Then, as they
moved forward in a troop towards the house,
drawing him on with them, they all began to
chatter together.</p>

<p>'You're not at all a good strategist, dad,'
said one. 'We heard you a mile off.'</p>

<p>'And we have been waiting about an hour,'
from another.</p>

<p>'Supper's on the table; and I'm as hungry&mdash;as
hungry&mdash;as a bear,' from a third.</p>

<p>'Oh! never mind Trixy,' cried a fourth silvery
voice, 'she's always hungry. Tell us about
<i>them</i>.'</p>

<p>'Weren't they frightfully surprised?'</p>

<p>'They must have thought you an angel for
going in to see them at once.'</p>

<p>'But how did they look? What did they
say?'</p>

<p>'Has Tom put on any airs yet?' This last
was from Miss Trixy.</p>

<p>'Girls! girls!' from the highest of the golden
heads, 'how is it possible for dad to answer you
if you all speak at once? Come in, father&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'No, dear, don't! Stay with us; we're quite
as fond of you as Grace.'</p>

<p>'And as fond of gossip, you cupboard-love
young women! Come, clear off, Grace
and all. There's not a pin to choose between
you.'</p>

<p>He spoke in what was known as his voice
of thunder&mdash;a voice which had often made a
thousand dusky warriors quake; but these
mischievous girls only chattered the more
rapidly, and clustered round him the more persistently.</p>

<p>'Where is your mother?' said the General.</p>

<p>'In the dining-room,' said Trixy, 'sitting like
patience on a monument, waiting for you.'</p>

<p>'Hear, dear! Am I so very late? I suppose
I did forget the time a little. Well, never mind.
Here we are! Mother, my dear,' stooping to
kiss the forehead of a pretty elderly lady who
was sitting in an armchair by a little wood fire,
stitching at white work and smiling placidly,
'you must excuse me. I am afraid I am late.'</p>

<p>'Are you late, dear?' she said, rising and
folding up her work, 'I didn't know. The time
slips away so quickly when one is busy. Oh,
the girls!' looking round affectionately. 'But
they are always hungry. River air and strong
exercise, I suppose. Trixy, dearest, father would
like to get rid of his coat and see his letters.
Call Yaseen Khan.'</p>

<p>Trixy, who was afraid to leave the room lest
interesting news should be given in her absence,
went to the door and called out, and in the next
instant an Indian servant, old, but handsome
still, and dressed in gay garments of white and
red and gold, a voluminous snow-white turban
crowning his dark eyes and dusky face, appeared
upon the threshold. The General asked him
one or two questions in rapid Hindustani; he
answered submissively, and then, going about
his business as steadily as if the issues of life and
death hung on its due performance, removed the
General's upper coat, his hat and gloves, and
laid before him the letters which had arrived by
the latest post.</p>

<p>The girls and their mother were in the meantime
taking their places round the table, which
was plainly furnished with cold meat, bread,
and salad. A dish of exquisite pink and yellow
roses occupied the centre, and there was a handsome
tea equipage opposite Lady Elton, and a
large silver bowl, heaped high with snowy rice,
at the General's end of the table. There was
certainly nothing luxurious here; but in the
arrangement of the meal, no less than in the
appearance of those who were partaking of it,
there was an unmistakable air of distinction and
refinement.</p>

<p>The girls were hungry after their day on the
river, and for a few moments there was little
heard but the clatter of knives and forks. Then
there was a little pause. The General, who had
glanced over his letters and laid them aside, was
looking across at his wife. 'I saw Mrs. Gregory
and her son,' he said tentatively.</p>

<p>Immediately five pairs of inquisitive eyes
were turned upon Lady Elton.</p>

<p>'Well!' she said, smiling. 'They had heard
the news, of course?'</p>

<p>'Cherry's letter had just arrived.'</p>

<p>'Only just! I am afraid you were a little in
the way, Wilfrid.'</p>

<p>'So I was, at first; but I think now it was
as well. They were curiously upset.'</p>

<p>'Poor dear Mrs. Gregory!' said Lady Elton
gently. 'I can well understand it.'</p>

<p>'I don't think I should be upset if I heard
that I had come into a large fortune,' said a
mutinous little voice at the General's end of the
table. 'But Tom&mdash;how did he take it?'</p>

<p>'Do be quiet, Trixy; let father speak,' whispered
the girl at her elbow.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Lady Elton, whose kind face had
grown curiously soft. 'Tell us about Tom.
The dear fellow is such a favourite of mine!
Do you know it is quite delightful to me to think
that he is well off&mdash;not, of course, that riches
mean happiness. I hope I am not so foolish as
to imagine that. There are other things'&mdash;looking
round her with a glow of happiness in
her sweet old eyes&mdash;that come far, far before
riches. Still it is pleasant to have a competence.
A number of little anxieties are knocked off at
once, and then you can do kind things without
counting the cost.'</p>

<p>'But, my dear wife,' said the General, 'permit
me to say that I don't think you have quite
grasped the position. The boy is the rajah of
Gumilcund's heir&mdash;his heir, mind you. Why,
he will be ridiculously&mdash;phenomenally rich!'</p>

<p>Lady Elton's colour rose, and she gave a little
troubled glance round the table, whence a prolonged
'Oh!' had risen. 'Then I can understand
his mother's uneasiness,' she said in a low voice.
'It is always troublesome and dangerous to be
exceptional.'</p>

<p>'But think of the pleasure and triumph if
you can be it well,' said Maud, the second girl.
It was she who had held the rudder-strings
in the boat that evening.</p>

<p>Then came the mutinous little voice in the
corner again.</p>

<p>'We are wandering from our point,' it cried
discontentedly. 'The point is Tom. Tom the
fortunate man, Tom the handsome man, Tom
the heir of this romantic person in India&mdash;what
did he say? How did he look? Did his eyes
shine? He has such expressive eyes, you know!
Never shake your head at me, Grace. You
said so yourself&mdash;I heard you&mdash;to mother,
"capable of expressing every shade of feeling"&mdash;those
were your very words.'</p>

<p>Upon this Grace blushed, a circumstance
which seemed to give the keenest satisfaction to
the mutinous little person in the corner; the
other girls laughed, and Lady Elton called them
to order. In a momentary lull the General was
heard to say:</p>

<p>'You young ladies observe pretty minutely,
I must confess.'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes!' cried Trixy. 'Girls, do let
father speak.'</p>

<p>'I was going to say, Trixy, that my eyes, I
am afraid, are not so clever as yours. As far as
I can remember, Tom took it very quietly, didn't
dance, didn't laugh, didn't put on height. His
eyes may have shone; but, as I am not a competent
observer, I refuse to pledge myself. My
impression is that when you see him next you
will know him.'</p>

<p>'Father, do you know that you are not at
all interesting?' cried the irrepressible Trixy.</p>

<p>'Oh! if you want romance you shall have
it. Give me five minutes&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You <i>know</i> we don't want romance. We
want facts.'</p>

<p>'Which I have given you, Miss Monkey.'</p>

<p>'A very meagre supply, dad.'</p>

<p>'Limited intelligences&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Excuse me, dad; people with powers of
observation and inference&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Take this girl away!' cried the General,
laughing. 'Inference, indeed, you monkey!
Why, there will be no living with you soon.
You have finished supper. Go, all of you!
Come, I dismiss you with my blessing! And,
Trixy&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes, dearest,' bleated the little creature.
'May I stay? I'll be as quiet as a mouse.'</p>

<p>'And drink in every word I say. No, thank
you. Tell Yaseen Khan to bring my hookah,
and then make yourself as scarce as you can. I
want to have a talk with mother.'</p>

<p>'I wish I were mother,' said Trixy, looking
back discontentedly. But she obeyed her
father.</p>

<h5><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h5>

<h4>'IN VISIONS OF THE NIGHT'</h4>


<p>Leaving the girls to think over what they had
heard, we return to the heir and his mother.
Unlike as they were in appearance and temperament,
a strong affection united them. Mrs.
Gregory had her weaknesses&mdash;her tremors, her
hesitations, her curious infelicities of speech and
action; but all of these her son tolerated, even, in
a sense, loved. What to him rose grandly above
them was the self-forgetting affection which
throughout his life had shone out before him.</p>

<p>She, naturally, adored him. He may not
have been altogether what she would have liked
him to be, but he was hers. She had watched
him through his infancy; in his childhood she
had made herself a child again that she might
love the things he loved; she had nursed
him in his little sicknesses; she had taught him
his catechism, and creed, and collects, and the
beautiful old stories of the Old and New Testaments;
with a full heart and passionate prayers
she had sent him out to the perilous little worlds
of school and college; and now it was her chief
interest and delight to provide him with the
physical comforts which, she always maintained,
kept the mind serene and the body vigorous.</p>

<p>Sometimes she was dimly conscious, poor soul,
that he was moving away from her spiritually.
Having caught scraps of his conversation here
and there, she had begun to feel afraid that his
ideas strayed beyond the limits of the faith she
had so patiently taught him. During the daytime,
when he was away, she would take up the
book he had been reading last&mdash;a volume of
transcendental poetry or a dry philosophical
treatise, and try&mdash;oh! so pitifully&mdash;to understand
what it was in it that interested him. Her
efforts were all in vain. After an hour of
patient effort she would put down the book
with a heavy sigh. Her failure was a measure
of the distance that separated them&mdash;a proof, if
any were needed, that they moved in different
worlds. 'What was the use of giving him to
me,' she would say to herself sometimes with a
curious bitterness, 'if he was only to belong to
me in his childhood? He is very little mine now.
He will soon not be mine altogether.'</p>

<p>But these were only moments in her life;
moments, indeed, of which Tom knew nothing;
and to say that to any appreciable degree they
coloured the every-day existence of the mother
and son would be extravagant. As a fact they
lived together harmoniously and pleasantly,
having entire confidence one in the other.</p>

<p>And so, on this strange evening, when the
General had gone and supper was over, Tom,
who was naturally burning to understand his
new position, expected that his mother would
sit down in her usual pleasant, gossipy way and
talk it over with him. No such thing. She
annoyed him by bustling about. There was a
letter she had forgotten to answer. Wouldn't
it do to-morrow? Certainly not (severely);
to-morrow had its own duties. Then an account
to be dotted up. Wouldn't Tom help her? she
said feebly. She had a poor head for figures.
While he was looking over it she slipped away,
and half an hour later, when he went in search
of her, he found her in the kitchen overlooking
Sarah's performances. She was so worn out
that he simply carried her away with him by
sheer force of will, and laid her down on the
conch in the drawing-room, where she remained
with her eyes closed for some minutes.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for herself she was too active
and restless to keep up any longer the feint of
repose. She got up for her work, and her son,
seizing his advantage, pursued her with questions.
Not one of those questions would Mrs.
Gregory answer directly. When he urged her,
saying he would rather she should answer them
than anyone else, she pleaded that she was as
bewildered as he was. He could understand
that, he said, but she must know more. For
instance, she had met the rajah&mdash;he had heard
her say so to General Elton. What was he
like?</p>

<p>'Did I say so?' said Mrs. Gregory.</p>

<p>'Mother dear,' cried the boy, 'do you object
to being questioned?'</p>

<p>'Oh no. Why should I?' she said, the
colour mounting to her face. 'But it is so
many, many years ago.'</p>

<p>'That you met the rajah?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'Still, you remember him.'</p>

<p>'As he was then?'</p>

<p>'Of course, as he was then. Couldn't you
give me your impression of him? That will be
some little guide.'</p>

<p>'Why are you so anxious, Tom?'</p>

<p>'Well, mother; but isn't it natural? He
has come into my life as a new power&mdash;new to
me, although, of course, he must have known of
me, and been thinking of me for a long time.'
Then breaking off: 'How pale you are, dearest;
have I said anything to hurt you?'</p>

<p>'No, no, it is nothing. It is only that I see
you moving away from me&mdash;so far&mdash;so far&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Mother!'</p>

<p>She came to herself with an effort. 'Forgive
me, my son,' she said. 'I am not very strong,
I suppose, and you know'&mdash;with a little smile&mdash;'a
great change like this always gives one a
certain shock.'</p>

<p>'I am tiring you with my silly questions.'</p>

<p>'Not at all; and I don't think they are
silly. It is natural you should wish to know
something of the man who has enriched you.
But I had rather, on the whole, you went to
Mr. Cherry. The business has been in his hands
for a number of years.'</p>

<p>'It isn't the business, mother&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I understand, dear. I understand perfectly.
Well!' drawing her lace shawl about her,
'another day. How curiously chilly it is
becoming! Will you shut the window?'</p>

<p>'Certainly, mother.' He had been sitting
close beside her. He now took a chair at a
little distance and took up a book.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gregory watched him with a wistful
pain at her heart. She was conscious to the
finger-tips of his disappointment, and she hated
herself for inflicting it; but there was nothing
to be done. She could not speak. She would
not if she could. Yet the distance he was
putting between them wounded her intolerably.
After she had borne it as long as she could she
called him. He was at her side at once. 'I
am afraid I have disappointed you, dear,' she
said. 'Sit down near me again, and we will
talk.'</p>

<p>He obeyed silently. He thought he would
give her the initiative this time, determining,
whatever she might say, not to show his feelings
again. By that delicate perception, which was
one of heaven's best gifts to him, he had long
since learned to understand and shield his
mother's sensitiveness.</p>

<p>She, poor woman, scarcely knowing what
she said, drifted into mysterious warnings and
entreaties. He must be wise; he must do
nothing rashly; he must be guided by Mr.
Cherry, who was a good man and a Christian.
Tom gave her the assurances she asked; but
they did not satisfy her; and, I think, it was a
relief to them both when, on the stroke of ten,
the little maid of the establishment came in with
her Bible to take part in the pathetic ceremony
with which their day always closed.</p>

<p>When his mother left him Tom sat down
and looked round for a few moments, blankly.
He was tired; but he could not rest until he
had thought out this strange thing that had
come to him, and here it was impossible to
think. The atmosphere of the room oppressed
him. He had a curious, irritating impression
that, though his mother's bodily presence had
gone, her spirit was haunting the place, preventing
him from thinking freely. At last he opened
the French window softly, let himself out into
the garden, and, allowing his feet to carry him
along mechanically, found himself presently on
the lower lawn, close by the boat-house and
willows. There he stopped and let his eyes
wander at their will. Ah! what a world it
was&mdash;this soft, mysterious midnight world of
June! Think! How could he think? But,
happily, there was no need yet. The hours of
the sweet summer night were before him. With
a deep inspiration, in which he seemed to be
throwing off a heavy burden, he flung himself
down on the grass, his face towards the sky, his
feet towards the river, while he gave himself
up to the rapturous sense-impressions of the
moment. He saw the upper sky, veiled here
and there with thin, vaporous cloud-wreaths;
and it was so near it seemed to be stooping to
embrace him. There was a streak of silver
between the cloud-wreaths. It shone out, disappeared,
shone out again, and the fleece about
it was tinged with pale gold. It was a horn
of the young moon&mdash;the moon on which
Endymion's heavenly love descended, when on
that starry night long ago she kissed his eyes
open to behold her. Through 'the solemn
midnight's tingling silentness' he could hear the
swish of the water as it swept over the long
grasses and reeds at his feet. Lovely water!
and the fish that swam in it, were they awake
too? Did they go on swimming all the night
through? Lovely water! And lovely, lovely
little earth! Ah! how sweet it was to live&mdash;only
to live and breathe in her arms on such
a night as this!</p>

<p>It might have been a moment, it might have
been an hour, that the boy lay upon the river
bank. He could never tell. Of the prick&mdash;the
tiny throb of self-consciousness, that called him
out suddenly from his Eden he would often speak
later with a smile. He sat up, frowned, drew
his relaxed muscles together. <i>This</i> was not what
he had meant when he came out into the solitude,
he said to himself severely. He was a man,
not a thing; it was a weakness, a folly, to allow
himself to drift into mere sensuousness.</p>

<p>Ha! what was that? He turned round suddenly.
It was a sound like a silver bell ringing
close beside him. If he had been a child he
might have thought that a fairy in a lily cup
was laughing at him; the sound was so definite,
so curiously round and clear.</p>

<p>Giving no attention to it he set himself
sternly to his task, and two or three ideas about
the relative values of riches and poverty&mdash;ideas
far too fine and exalted to be put down here&mdash;followed
one another through his mind. It was
a young mind, as we know. Young minds are
superior. If we have ever tried to walk on a
tightrope, get up early in the morning, or take
a precipitous hillside at a rush, and succeeded,
we shall know how they feel. It is their newness
which we experienced people should not
grudge them. In a little time&mdash;we know how
very little&mdash;they will find out that there is nothing
new under the sun.</p>

<p>Now the young heir, who was exceedingly
new, felt a certain throb of exultation in the circumstance
that he was able to feel as a serious
man should when a great change comes into his
life. The train of thought being pleasant he
followed it out. I believe he made one or two
correct resolutions. He would not be led away
into foolish and selfish extravagance; he would
avoid flatterers; he would do as much good as
he could with his money. Not original. Oh
dear no! commonplace, I am afraid. But goodness
is just the one thing that does not require
genius to conceive it. I wonder if that is the
reason why it is so often thought dull? The
kind of thinking on which Tom was engaged
tends to restlessness, and hence the downfall
which I am about to record.</p>

<p>He got up from the grass, and walking on
aimlessly left his mother's garden, and went on
for a few paces down the road. Presently he
pulled up with a smile and a start. He was at
the side gate of the Eltons' garden. An irresistible
desire seized him to go in. Trying the
latch, and finding the gate unlocked, he stole in
noiselessly. He was in a narrow path that led
through a thick shrubbery. In its midst he
paused. All his wise thoughts, all his correct
resolutions, had flown, and his heart was beating
fast and furiously. What was this&mdash;what was
this&mdash;which was rushing through him, tingling
in his veins like wine of Paradise? 'And a
spirit in my feet'&mdash;he murmured the words half
aloud&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">'A spirit in my feet</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Hath led me&mdash;who knows how?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To thy chamber-window, sweet.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>Slowly he went on along the dark little path.
It came out on the rose-garden, Grace's special
pride and care, which was now in its full glory.
By the faint light of the summer dawning, for
the night was already on the turn, he could see
the clustered blossoms, crimson and pink and
yellow, hanging from trellises and pillars, and
weighing down the branches of the young standards.
But it was not this that made him pause
and catch at a pillar of the verandah for support.
Once already that night the beauty of the earth
had touched him. Now it was something more.
As he stood the branch of a tall standard was
swept towards him by the breeze. There were
roses on it, opened and half opened. He caught
at it passionately. Ah! how well he knew the
touch of the soft pale petals, the odour they exhaled!
It was a La Trance, Grace's favourite
rose. The last time he saw her she had worn
one in her girdle. Scarcely knowing what he
did he kissed the sweet flower that had touched
him. But in the next instant the colour had
flooded his face, and he was passing on rapidly
to the lawn by the river, for it was as if he had
stolen what he had not won, as if his lips and
her lips had met on the petals of the flower that
was her darling.</p>

<p>At the end of the lawn there was a bank
crowned with willows, at whose roots purple
loosestrife and rosy willow-herb were growing.
He could see these things dimly as he looked out
before him. Under one of the willows was a
rustic seat, where the girls often clustered in the
evening. Tom sat down upon it and gave himself
up to the dreams that were crowding upon
him. Dreams! Dreams! In a misty radiance
of lovely shapes they swept by him. What a
fool he had been! It was the beauty of nature;
it was love that binds young lives together; it
was passion, whose feet were on earth, and whose
soul was in heaven which was the reality.
These other things&mdash;reason, philosophy, maxims
of prudence&mdash;they were an illusion&mdash;webs that
the dull of heart weave to hide their own dullness
from themselves. And, after all, why should a
man think; why should a man be serious when
happiness such as this&mdash;<i>this!</i> was opening out
before him?</p>

<p>He got up and walked on for a few steps.
His feet were unsteady, and, with a smile of self-ridicule,
he sat down again. He spread out his
arms with a low cry. 'Grace!' he murmured.
'Grace! do you know that I love you?'</p>

<p>He paused. The faint, sweet kiss of the
pale-petaled rose was lingering about his lips.
He was remembering how, two days ago, only
two, when he and she were together here&mdash;here
at this very spot, he had longed to speak
but dared not. That rose was in her girdle.
His lips had been open to ask for it. Something
had sealed them. He was too young&mdash;too insignificant&mdash;his
fortunes were too uncertain.
For her sweet sake he had held himself in check.</p>

<p>Now&mdash;ah! everything had changed. He
was no longer insignificant&mdash;he was the heir of
a man of wealth and distinction&mdash;his fortunes
were certain&mdash;he could make a future for the
woman he loved. If, as he had imagined,
dreamed&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But he could go no further. He flung himself
on the grass. His lips were towards the
earth, and it was as if he was speaking to <i>it</i>&mdash;telling
it the secret ecstasy that he had not
breathed to any living soul. 'I could not speak
then, but I can now. This wealth has freed my
hand. They will listen to me&mdash;they must! And
she! Oh, Grace! oh, my darling! Come to
me and I will make the earth a Paradise to you!
Others do not know what love means. They
promise and they forget. I never will. My love!
my beautiful love! Come to me, and let me
care for you. I will, I will. Care for you as
never woman was cared for before. Your
lightest wish shall be my law. Your very
imaginations and dreams shall come to pass.
You and I, Grace, you and I&mdash;our two lives
shall flow on together, loving and beloved,
until&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>What was this? He pulled up short. It
was a pang, sudden and swift, like a cold hand
on his heart. He rose slowly, and found that
his limbs were stiff, and that his clothes were
wet with the night dews. Like one in a maze
he went on, for a few steps, blindly. The roots
of a willow stopped him, and he saw that he
was on the edge of the sloping bank that ran
down to the river. He stood where he was,
gazing out before him, with eyes that saw
nothing. In that little instant all his ecstasy
had gone, to be replaced by a dull misery such
as he had never felt before. Between night and
morning there is a moment when life is said to
run sluggishly in the veins of earth's children.
It is then that the long-tortured drop into blissful,
if brief unconsciousness; that watchers nod
drowsily; and that the dying fall on the sleep
that knows no waking. That moment had come.</p>

<p>Tom lifted his heavy lids and looked round
him. A chill stole through his frame, penetrating
to the very marrow of his bones. He
buttoned his coat up to the chin and turned to
leave the garden. But in the next instant he
was transfixed. It was as if a hand of iron was
laid upon his wrist, compelling him to stand
where he was.</p>

<p>He passed his hand before his eyes dreamily.</p>

<p>When, after a brief interval, he looked up,
it seemed to him that the colour of the water
had changed from the pale crystal of the
morning to deep blood-red. The trees were
changing too, taking strange and undistinguishable
shapes, while there came towards him on
the breeze a confused murmur as of a multitude
of steps and voices.</p>

<p>Again he closed his eyes; again he strove to
shake off the leaden weights that held his feet in
prison; but it was useless. He looked up to
find all the familiar features of the landscape
gone. What had been the river was a zone of
burning sand over which hung a sky lurid and
awful; the confused murmur was still in his
ears; but it had drawn nearer, and the crimson
cloud that had hung between earth and heaven
seemed to be descending and distributing itself
in multitudinous forms. Then, in a moment or
less, the zone of sand is filled with figures&mdash;figures
dark of face and threatening of aspect,
that brandish steel-bright swords in their hands.</p>

<p>He looks, but he cannot stir. It seems to
him in those awful moments that there is more
to come&mdash;that he is waiting for it. Suddenly it
rises&mdash;or has it been there all the time and has
he not seen it?&mdash;the vision of a woman, in white
garments, with golden hair and sad, wild eyes.
<i>Her</i> face&mdash;not as he has ever seen it; but hers.
A groan breaks from his lips. 'It is a dream,'
he says to himself. 'It is a dream.'</p>

<p>But a sound rises above the fierce cries of
the warriors, a sound piercing and shrill; it is
the voice of his love, wild with terror, calling
out upon his name. Passionately he tries to
reach her but he cannot, and all the time, like
the wild insulting chorus of fiends, his own
words, 'Come to me, and I will make the world
a Paradise to you,' are running through his
brain.</p>

<p>His limbs are trembling now, and the cold
drops of anguish stand upon his brow. 'Oh,
God!' he cries, 'I have sinned. Be merciful!
I can bear no more!'</p>

<p>Scarcely are the words out of his lips before
the blood-red pavement, the fierce faces, and the
lurid sky have gone. But she&mdash;his love&mdash;is
still before him, a pale, sweet phantom, with
wonder and a wistful tenderness in its eyes.</p>

<p>In that same instant the chain that had
bound his limbs is loosened. Crying out 'Grace!
Grace!' he dashes forward blindly.</p>

<p>In the next instant our dreamer found himself
sprawling on his back upon the grass, two
hands of iron holding him down, and a pair of
glittering grey eyes above him.</p>

<p>'No, you don't,' said an irate voice, as he
tried to release himself. 'No, you don't, sir.
If you must commit suicide I can't help it, of
course, but it shall not be in my compound.
Keep, still, I tell you, madman! I'm not so young
as I was, but I'm strong enough to fight you,
and, by Jove, if you attempt to stir, down you
go again.'</p>

<p>By the time this harangue was over Tom had
recognised the features of his captor, realised
the absurd nature of his position, and was laughing
heartily.</p>

<p>'Is it you, General?' he said.</p>

<p>'You know me, I hope,' said the old soldier
sternly.</p>

<p>'Oh yes, perfectly. Would you be kind
enough? Thank you,' as the General, who
was reflecting that intending suicides did not
generally preface their last exit with so natural
a laugh as this of Tom's, relaxed his hold. 'Do
you know, General, your hands are like iron?'
Tom sprang to his feet as he spoke.</p>

<p>'Like iron are they?' he said. 'Well, they
have had to do hard work in their time. But
come, boy&mdash;seriously&mdash;I should like to know
what you mean by it.'</p>

<p>'By what, General?'</p>

<p>'By being here at this extraordinary hour to
begin with. I don't believe, myself, that you
have been in bed all night.'</p>

<p>Tom looked sheepish. It would not quite
have done to quote Shelley's couplet to the
General, and there was absolutely no other
reason to give for his presence in the garden
save that 'the spirit in his feet had led him
thither.'</p>

<p>'I am really very sorry&mdash;&mdash;,' he began.</p>

<p>'Understand me,' interrupted the General,
mollified by his penitence, but feeling bound to
express his displeasure: 'I have no objection to
see you either in the garden or in the house. I
have begged you again and again to come and
go as you please. Lady Elton has done the
same. She has a strong regard for you, and so
have I. But, sir, when you go in for extraordinary
athletic performances, I must beg you
to find another field than mine for the display
of your talent. Also'&mdash;and here his very hair
seemed to bristle with indignation&mdash;'to find
another name than my daughter's to hang rhapsodies
to. A very pretty little story would have
got about if anyone but myself had been here.
And,' he added as he turned away, 'there's too
much talking as it is.'</p>

<p>The reddest of Grace's roses was scarcely as
red as Tom's face when the General turned away
from him.</p>

<p>'Did I?' he stammered. 'I beg your
pardon&mdash;hers, I mean. I must have been
dreaming. I couldn't sleep last night, General,
and&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Now, a confession was the very last thing
the General desired. He broke in hastily:</p>

<p>'All right, my dear fellow, all right. I
mustn't be too down upon you. It was a tremendous
piece of news that you received last
night, quite enough to set a young man's wits
wool-gathering. But take it quietly, if you can.
In six months, if I know human nature, you will
be so much accustomed to it that you will feel
as if you had been rich all your life.'</p>

<p>'But it isn't the riches,' began poor Tom,
tremulously. 'It is&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes. I understand. The change&mdash;prodigious,
as you say. Now don't talk any
more. Go home like a sensible fellow and have
a good sleep.'</p>

<p>'If I might have a little conversation with
you first, sir&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Impossible, my dear boy. Quite out of the
question. Look at these'&mdash;pointing to the pot-plants&mdash;roses
and geraniums and fuchsias and
lilacs, which Yaseen Khan and the gardener
were bringing down in batches and placing
beside the river&mdash;'all to be seen to before the
sun rises.'</p>

<p>'I shall not be long. I only want to ask you
a single question.'</p>

<p>'But how long will it take to answer? No,
no; I am not going to be betrayed into an argument.
It takes all one's wit, I can tell you, to
deal with one's plants.'</p>

<p>As the General talked he worked. He had
thrown off his coat and tucked up his shirt-sleeves,
and lighted a small briarwood pipe, and
he was moving about briskly among the plants,
watering them, syringing them, washing blight
off their foliage, loosening the earth about their
roots, and drenching them with tobacco-smoke.</p>

<p>Tom meanwhile held his ground, watching
him. Whenever there was a pause he would
jump up, as the old man said to himself discontentedly,
'like a Jack-in-the-box.' But he
never found an opening for the little conversation
that he so earnestly desired, and finally the
flight of time and the General's perseverance
carried the day. In a few moments, if he remained
where he was, a bevy of laughing girls
would be down upon him, pouring out questions
which he might find it difficult to answer.</p>

<p>So he rose regretfully. 'I will come again,
when you are not so busy,' he said.</p>

<p>'Yes, yes; certainly,' said the General, cordially.
'Come again, by all means. You are
always welcome. But if I don't look to the
plants early they suffer. Good rest to you, my
boy, and a pleasant awakening.'</p>

<p>When Tom had gone he breathed a deep
sigh of relief. But his work flagged, and in a few
moments he left the gardener to finish it, and
went up slowly to the house, to see if 'mother'
was awake.</p>

<p>'That's the worst of having girls,' he said to
himself discontentedly. 'There is always something
brewing. Now, if four of them were
boys&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Ah! but which four? That was the difficulty.
It seems unreasonable, but it is the
simple truth: for 'a wilderness of boys,' each
of them as handsome as Tom Gregory, the
General would not have given the least of his
little girls.</p>

<h5><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a></h5>

<h4>A MYSTERIOUS LEGACY</h4>


<p>Mr. Cherry, head partner of the firm of Cherry
&amp; Lawrence, sat in his private room, expecting
the young heir. A japanned box, bearing the
Bracebridge name on its lid, was at his feet;
a bulky packet, sealed with many seals and
addressed 'Thomas Gregory,' was on the table
beside him; and the parchment wrapper, out of
which, apparently, the packet had been taken,
lay spread out on his desk. The wrapper bore
the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'To William Cherry, of the City of London,
solicitor,&mdash;My will and last instructions are
sealed up in this packet, which I desire may be
opened by you after my death, or, in case of
your dying before me, by the representative you
may appoint. By the love you bear me, I beseech
you to see my last wishes carried out.'</p>

<p>(Signed) '<span class="smcap">Byrajee Pirtha Raj</span>.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Four years before this mysterious packet had
been conveyed to Mr. Cherry by a secure hand.
He was an old man, and the rajah was in the
prime of life. It had never, therefore, occurred
to him that his would be the hand to open it.
But the unexpected had befallen. The rajah
had fallen by the knife of an assassin; and
when Mr. Cherry, in the presence of two witnesses,
opened the parcel left with him, he found
a formal, unusually brief will, duly signed and
witnessed, with the packet already mentioned,
which was to be given as it was into the hands
of the heir.</p>

<p>By this time Mr. Cherry had recovered from
his first shock of surprise, but to any who
knew him well it would have been evident that
he was still extraordinarily moved. He was a
person well known in London at that time. His
mellifluous voice, his gift of well-balanced and
persuasive speech, and his dignified manner,
with the snow-white hair that became him so
well, the broad massive forehead, determined
mouth, and calm blue eyes, made him the very
prince of family solicitors. The world said Mr.
Cherry had mistaken his vocation: lawn sleeves
and a bishop's crozier would have suited him far
better than a lawyer's gown. Mr. Cherry agreed
with the world. But Providence&mdash;a power towards
which he maintained and instilled the
deepest reverence&mdash;had decreed it otherwise,
and he accepted his lot with cheerfulness, bringing
the gifts that would have adorned another
profession to the service of that into which he
had been thrown. It must be confessed that
the gifts had proved useful. Mr. Cherry had a
large and distinguished flock of clients, enriched
by whose gratitude he could have retired
years before from the arena of public life. But
to retire was just the one thing that they would
not let him do. It was whispered that men and
women went to him as to a father-confessor;
that secrets which would have staggered the
brain of an ordinary man were hidden away
securely behind that calm, wide brow; and that
the reputations and fortunes of some of the
noblest families in England were in his keeping.
However that may have been, it is certain that
no one ever repented having confided in him.
His clients were his children, whom it was his
pleasure, no less than his duty, to protect and
guide.</p>

<p>The Bracebridges had for years belonged to
the number of Mr. Cherry's flock. The rajah
who had just died was their last male representative,
for the English branch had long died
out, and the family property, to the profound
grief of the old lawyer, had passed into other
hands. Mrs. Gregory, whose small patrimony
he had nursed carefully, was the only one left of
the family; and although he was on perfectly
good terms with her, he had allowed her, when
she married Captain Gregory, to pass out of the
sphere of his influence. He was sorry to-day
that he had not seen more of her boy.</p>

<p>'It is a great responsibility to fall upon
young shoulders,' he said to himself, 'and I fear
the instructions won't help him much&mdash;a mysterious,
a <i>most</i> mysterious dispensation of Providence.
May God help and guide the poor
boy!'</p>

<p>This was not a mere form. Mr. Cherry did
believe firmly in a Power overruling the seemingly
capricious allotments of what fools call
fate. That he felt it expedient from time to
time to remind this august Ordainer of the
consequences that might flow from His mysterious
dispositions was a fault rather of the
head than of the heart. He had himself in his
small way more than once played the part of
a human Providence, and he was conscious,
even to morbidness, of the importance of the
rôle.</p>

<p>While he sat thinking Tom was shown in.
He rose and saluted him gravely. 'Mr. Gregory,'
he said, 'I congratulate you. This is a great
change in your fortunes.'</p>

<p>'So great, Mr. Cherry, that I have not been
able to realise it yet.'</p>

<p>'I can understand that. But sit down. I
will try, with your leave, to make things clear
to you. Mrs. Gregory, of course&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'One moment, Mr. Cherry,' broke in Tom.
'I must begin by telling you that my mother has
told me nothing. I did not know, until yesterday,
that we had any Indian relatives at all. I
asked her to explain, and she referred me to
you.'</p>

<p>'Very strange! very strange!' said the lawyer
musingly. 'Mrs. Gregory was surprised?'</p>

<p>'She was more than surprised.'</p>

<p>'Shocked?'</p>

<p>'Yes; I believe she was really shocked,'
said Tom. 'My mother told me, you know, to
speak to you freely,' he added.</p>

<p>'Certainly. I should be pained if you did
not,' said Mr. Cherry in his most impressive
manner. 'Mr. Gregory, I have been the friend
of your mother's family for three generations.
They have all treated me with confidence. You,
it seems, are chosen to carry on the traditions of
the race. Why this is, I must tell you frankly,
I cannot even guess. But it is so. If you
permit it, I will be your friend as I have been
theirs.'</p>

<p>'Thank you,' said Tom, grasping cordially
the hand which the old lawyer extended to him.
'I accept your offer with pleasure. And I only
hope I may prove worthy of your friendship.'</p>

<p>These preliminaries over, they proceeded to
business. In a few clear words Mr. Cherry
explained to Tom what the relationship had
been between his mother and the rajah. The
will, which should be laid before him presently,
was of the simplest. There were a few legacies
to servants and retainers, a bequest to Mr.
Cherry, and the remainder absolutely, in the
words of the will, to 'Thomas Gregory, my
cousin's son.'</p>

<p>'Are there no conditions?' asked Tom.</p>

<p>'None whatever. I gather from a private
letter, which I will put in your hands, that you
are nominated as your cousin's successor in the
raj. But, as Gumilcund has been for some years
a protected state, the Company will have something
to say about that. You had better put
yourself in communication with the Lieutenant
Governor. There is a resident, who will look
after things there meanwhile. I have <i>heard</i> that
Lord Dalhousie had a particular affection for
Gumilcund. But this is all for the future.'</p>

<p>'Whatever my responsibilities may be,' said
Tom, 'I assure you that I have no desire to
shirk them.'</p>

<p>'Well said,' answered Mr. Cherry. 'But we
must be patient. We must do nothing in a hurry.
I may tell you, in the meantime, that your
cousin had a considerable amount of property
in England. He sent over his surplus revenues
for us to invest. This was with the view, I
believe, of carrying out some new scheme. We
have large sums in our hands now waiting to be
dealt with, and you can draw upon them as soon
as you like. I keep a clerk on purpose to deal
with what we call the Indian-Bracebridge property&mdash;an
intelligent fellow, and a keen man of
business. He shall wait upon you at whatever
time you like to name, and give you every sort
of information.'</p>

<p>Here he paused and cleared his throat. The
dramatic moment of the interview had come,
and it had to be met with proper dignity.</p>

<p>'You have something more to tell me,' said
Tom.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Mr. Cherry impressively. 'I have
something more to tell you. A will, as I have
often said, is public property. It is the duty of
the law to see it carried out. But men may
have wishes as well as intentions, although they
may not think it prudent to complicate their last
will and testament by inserting them. In such
case they will often leave them behind in other
forms, leaving it to their successors to carry them
out. This, I imagine, your cousin the rajah
has done.' He drew forward the sealed packet.
'Inside the wrapper which contained the rajah's
will,' he went on, 'I found this.'</p>

<p>'How strange! How very strange!' said
Tom. 'This is just what I was hoping for.'</p>

<p>'Take it away with you,' said Mr. Cherry,
'and open it at your leisure. But let me say one
word first. There can be nothing legally binding
in these papers. You will read them, of
course, and no doubt you will try to act in their
spirit; but I should not advise you to attempt
to follow them slavishly. Your cousin, though
he had an English grandfather, was an Asiatic
of the Asiatics.'</p>

<p>'Was he a Mohammedan?'</p>

<p>'No; nor, I believe, a Hindu; but he was
not a Christian. I am afraid he had no settled
religion unless at the last; there is just the
hope. The truth was put before him faithfully,
though in weakness,' said Mr. Cherry, his voice
faltering. 'What I mean by his being an Asiatic
is that his sympathies were rather with the East
than with the West. He was one of the greatest
Sanskrit and Persian scholars of our generation.
I am told he knew the Vedas and the Zend
Avesta, not to speak of all the great Hindu
poems and the mass of Buddhistic literature, as
we know our Bibles. It was marvellous that
one mind could have carried so much learning.
Yes, and he was a delightful man to meet&mdash;courteous,
gracious. He had the most wonderful
way of setting his friends at their ease and
overcoming their prejudices. I think sometimes
now that, but for this charm of manner, I might
have been more faithful with him. But'&mdash;very
sadly&mdash;'the opportunity has gone.'</p>

<p>As he spoke he rose from his seat. He saw
by the strained look in Tom's face that he was
listening to him with an effort. 'Excuse me,' he
said, 'I am an old man, and, I suppose, garrulous.
You are anxious to be alone with your
papers.'</p>

<p>'I shall open them at home,' said Tom
quietly. 'I am much obliged to you, Mr.
Cherry. I will come again when I have read
them, and perhaps you will tell me more about
my cousin then. I assure you'&mdash;smiling&mdash;'I
cannot hear too much.'</p>

<p>'The boy has <i>their</i> manner&mdash;their look too,'
said the old lawyer to himself when he was left
alone. 'I wonder where he got it? Harking
back, I suppose. A very strange thing this
heredity is&mdash;a very strange thing indeed!'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was afternoon when Tom returned to the
cottage. Finding, no little to his relief, that his
mother was out, he hurried up to his room, shut
and locked the door, and drew out his mysterious
packet. As he sat with it before him his heart
beat more quickly than usual, for he felt like
one called upon to converse with spirits and to
enter into the secret counsels of the dead.</p>

<p>Then, his excitement increasing as he proceeded,
he began to break one by one the seals
with which it was closed. At the last seal he
paused, and cast a rapid glance round the room,
whispering half aloud: 'Is anyone there?'</p>

<p>There was no answer, and his glance, which had
been merely mechanical, for he <i>knew</i> no one had
come into the room with him, strayed to the
window. 'I am dreaming as I did last night,'
he said to himself bitterly. 'If this sort of thing
goes on I shall be a perfect visionary soon, fit
for nothing but a lunatic asylum. Ah!' he
interrupted himself, 'what is that?'</p>

<p>At the word he leapt up, crossed the room
in one bound, threw the Venetian shutters open,
and looked out. There was no one&mdash;absolutely
no one&mdash;not a human being within sight or
sound. The Sleeping Beauty's palace could
scarcely have been more still than this green
garden world, as it lay basking in the light of
the golden afternoon.</p>

<p>Calling himself by a variety of contemptuous
names, Tom strode back to his seat. There
should be no more of this foolish nonsense, he
said, and he broke the last seal. The wrapper
at once fell open, revealing a little pile of papers,
which appeared to be covered with minute
handwriting. Tom's heart was by this time
beating like a sledge-hammer. What was he
going to hear? What was he going to see?
He took up the first paper and examined it
closely; but how great was his disappointment
when he found that he could not make out a
word of it! He passed rapidly to the next. It
was as unintelligible. Two&mdash;three&mdash;four he
unfolded; the result was the same. To his eye,
unpractised in Oriental writings, one was exactly
like the other. This, he said to himself bitterly,
was like offering a man bread and giving him a
stone. At last, when he had gone through
nearly the whole of the pile of papers, he came
to one different in appearance from any of the
others. It was smaller in size, but thicker, and
the leaves were gummed together at the edges.
He was about to open it when he saw that there
was an inscription on the outside, written in
characters exceedingly minute, but not Oriental.
He held it up to the light and read as follows:
'Unless you are capable of forming a firm resolution,
go no further!'</p>

<p>While he was wondering what this might
mean he turned the roll over, and saw that
words were written on the other side also.
These were still stranger: 'If you are brave and
resolute, open without fear.'</p>

<p>He paused to think. It was so silent in the
room that he could hear the beating of his own
heart. He was asking himself if he had the
qualities required by his mysterious benefactor,
and wondering what could be the nature of the
secret which must be approached in so resolute
a spirit. Weird stories of dim antiquity&mdash;of
beautiful things grasped at by eager hands and
won, but won through strife, and blood, and
tears&mdash;floated through his brain as he sat hesitating,
the unopened roll before him. Suddenly
he found himself speaking, uttering the thought
that was passing through his mind. 'I think I
could act with resolution if the necessity arose.
I am not all I should be; of that I am well aware;
but&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>And here he broke short, for the impression
he had combated a few moments before had
come to him again, and this time with a force
that there was no denying. For an instant he
sprang up wildly. Then, feeling dazed and
helpless, he sank back, covering his face with
his hands.</p>

<p>In the next moment a clear, low voice was
sounding through the room. 'You mistake.
It is not a question of worthiness, or even of
ability. The qualities we want are four:
humility and honesty&mdash;and these you have
proved that you possess; courage, which you do
not deny yourself; and an obedient mind, which
you may possibly have to learn. Open the
paper and learn its secrets!'</p>

<p>'Who are you that presume to command
me?' said Tom tremulously.</p>

<p>'That I may not tell you. I have been near
you all your life, but never so near as now,
when the Holy Ones have permitted me to be
the bearer of their message. The good that is
given, they say, must be expended in good.'</p>

<p>'Do you doubt that I feel it?' cried Tom.</p>

<p>'It is because I do not that I encourage you
to open the paper.'</p>

<p>'But why&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I can tell you nothing. The past has
gone from me. You must learn, moreover, as
it is given to you to learn, not altogether, but
little by little, and learning first an obedient
mind.'</p>

<p>'To whom is my obedience to be given?'</p>

<p>'That will be shown to you. First steps
must ever be taken with faith. Have courage!'</p>

<p>'It is not cowardice that makes me hesitate.'</p>

<p>'You are right. It is honesty. Then take
time. To-night you will decide.'</p>

<p>At this moment, when all Tom's nerves were
tingling, there broke upon his ears sounds so
familiar that in an instant they put to flight the
weird impressions under which he had been
labouring. 'Tom; I say, Tom! The dear boy is
asleep or he would answer. I will go and see.'
It was his mother's cheerful voice that rang up
the stairway. In another moment her hand
was on the door. 'Why, it is locked!' she
cried. 'Are you asleep, dear? Let me in!'
And she gave a series of impatient taps.</p>

<p>'In one moment,' said Tom.</p>

<p>He gathered up the heap of papers, threw
them into his writing-drawer, looked searchingly
round the room, and then, whispering under his
breath, 'Until to-night!' opened the door to
admit his mother.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h5><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a></h5>

<h4>WHAT THE MOON AND RIVER SAID</h4>


<p>'Were you asleep, dear?' said Mrs. Gregory
gently.</p>

<p>As she spoke she cast her eye timidly round
the room. It fell on the writing-drawer, which
Tom had not been able to shut on account of
the quantity of papers. 'You have been busy?'
she said with a vague smile.</p>

<p>'My business will keep,' he answered. 'Only
some papers, mother&mdash;about the property, I
suppose. Mr. Cherry gave them to me this
morning. They were with the will&mdash;addressed
to me.'</p>

<p>'How strange! And you have read them?'</p>

<p>'Not yet. They seem rather elaborate. I
expect they will take time.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Gregory brightened. 'Then they must
keep,' she said cheerfully, 'for I want you.
Lady Winter and her son are in the drawing-room.
They have come on purpose to congratulate
you, and I should like you to see
them.'</p>

<p>'Very well, mother. Just let me make myself
tidy first.'</p>

<p>'All right, dear, and I will entertain them.
You know,' she lingered, looking at him wistfully,
'Lady Winter has always been so nice to
me; and Sir Reginald knows everyone. He
could help you on in society. You will make
yourself pleasant to them&mdash;for my sake?'</p>

<p>'My dear mother,' said the boy, turning his
strained-looking eyes upon her, 'I will do my
best. No one can do any more.'</p>

<p>With a little sigh she left him and returned
to her visitors.</p>

<p>Society has some curious arrangements. It
reverses, as a general rule, the Scriptural order.
Those who honour themselves it delights to set
on high in its banquets, while the humble are
allowed to fill perpetually the low seats that
they have chosen. Lady Winter honoured herself,
and her honour was accepted as the true
estimate of her worth. She seldom paid calls.
She received them. Her parties were general,
for if anyone who could by any possibility be
said to belong to society had been shut out
there would have been painful heart-burnings,
and her neighbours, many of whom were far
richer than herself, were flattered when she
accepted little services, such as the use of their
carriages, and presents of flowers and fruit, game
and vegetables. Besides preserving this comfortable
worship she could do three things well.
She could dress so as to hide the ravages of
time; she could manage a small income with
grace and success; and she could say pretty
things with an <i>abandon</i> that marvellously enhanced
their charm. She had in consequence
many friends. Amongst these Mrs. Gregory, as
she was telling her to-day, had always taken a
high place. Some people might have thought
that the change in their fortunes had quickened
the flame of friendship. Mrs. Gregory did not.
She was a simple woman, and Lady Winter,
as she had told her son, had always been very
nice to her.</p>

<p>But her face flushed a little at the kind
words.</p>

<p>'And to think that you are rich!' said Lady
Winter.</p>

<p>'It isn't me,' said Mrs. Gregory. 'It is
my boy.'</p>

<p>'But it is the same thing, of course. An
only boy&mdash;and one so devoted. Ah! you may
smile. We all know. I only wish my Reginald
were half as nice to me! Well, as you know,
I don't think much of riches myself. I had
them once. Sir Thomas was a millionaire when
we married&mdash;supposed to be one at least. Poor
man! he thought nothing good enough for me&mdash;nothing!
I tried to protest. It was of no
use. If I didn't accept the lovely things he gave
me it made him miserable. The riches took
flight, and, curiously enough, I am as happy.
A few years and it will not make much difference
whether we have been rich or poor. We all
stand on the same ground at last. But,' as the
door opened, 'here is your son. My dear boy,'
holding out an exquisitely gloved hand, 'allow
your mother's old friend to congratulate you on
your good fortune. I know <i>someone</i>,' with a
flattering smile, 'who will be enchanted to hear
it. But I think I shall keep <i>her</i> out of the way
a little while.'</p>

<p>'Good fortune, indeed!' The voice came
from the depths of a low lounging-chair, in
which a long-limbed, handsome youth was
reclining. This was Sir Reginald Winter. He
rose languidly, and went forward to meet Tom.
'When my mother has done,' he said with his
sleepy smile, 'perhaps I may be allowed to
shake hands with you. Many happy returns of
the day! Isn't that the proper form? By Jove,
though,' laughing, 'if you had more than one,
there wouldn't be room for anyone else. I hear
you are a millionaire.'</p>

<p>'I think he scarcely knows how he stands,'
said Mrs. Gregory nervously.</p>

<p>'Of course not,' said Lady Winter. 'I believe
you only heard of it yourselves last night.
Some of the Eltons told <i>us</i>. Charming people
the Eltons! I am positively in love with
those dear girls. But such gossips. Ah!' lifting
up her grey-gloved hands, 'how they can
talk! If I had secrets I had rather confide
them to the town-crier than to that amiable
family.'</p>

<p>'But this is no secret,' said Mrs. Gregory,
the colour mounting to her face.</p>

<p>'Tom's good fortune! Oh dear no; why
should it be? I only wished to explain how it
was that we knew so early. You know,' in a
low voice, 'I couldn't help being a little excited.
We are both mothers&mdash;both left alone early. I
have so often sympathised with you in your
anxieties&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I know&mdash;I know,' answered Mrs. Gregory
affectionately. 'And I can't tell you how pleasant
your sympathy is to me. We have so
many kind friends here. Their interest and
affection have touched me deeply.' She cast an
appealing glance at Tom, who looked painfully
wooden and irresponsive. 'I am sure my son
feels with me,' she added.</p>

<p>This seemed to arouse Tom, for he murmured
something indefinite about being much obliged.</p>

<p>'Never mind,' whispered Lady Winter to
Mrs. Gregory. 'Young men are all alike. They
don't care for congratulations. Reginald was
just the same. When my poor old aunt died
the other day, you know, and left him that little
bit of money, and people told me how glad they
were, he behaved quite naughtily. "Really,"
he said at last, "I wish she hadn't; I'm sick of
hearing of it."'</p>

<p>'Then I think he was very ungrateful,' said
Mrs. Gregory severely. 'A pretty sort of place
the world would be if we had no one to rejoice
and grieve with us!'</p>

<p>'That is the woman's view, my dear friend.
But men, you know&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Men!' echoed Mrs. Gregory scornfully.
'Boys!'</p>

<p>'Oh come! my friend Tom is not quite a
boy,' said Lady Winter, with a smile of exquisite
graciousness towards that irresponsive
person.</p>

<p>'Well done, mother. I shall treasure that
up,' laughed Sir Reginald. 'I am called a boy
often enough, Mrs. Gregory, and I am ages
older than Tom. I say, Gregory, what do you
say to a stroll and a weed? A fellow is taking
my new outrigger up and down. I should like
you to see it.'</p>

<p>'Take Sir Reginald to the summer-house.
Tom,' said Mrs. Gregory; 'it has such a cheerful
look-out. And bring him back to tea. Yes,
Lady Winter, you must stay, both of you. The
boys will like to have their chat out quietly, and
Lady Elton and two of the dear girls are coming
in presently.'</p>

<p>'But we shall be too many for you.'</p>

<p>'Not at all. I must tell you,' whispered
Mrs. Gregory as Tom went off with Sir Reginald,
'that I had in additional help to-day. Such a
smart little servant; a capital cook, and knows
how to wait at table. She was five years in her
last place, and has <i>such</i> a character! It seemed
almost a Providence, if it isn't irreverent to say
so. It was my dear boy'&mdash;she looked out with
dewy eyes to where she could see her son's tall
slender figure on the sunlit lawn. 'He says I
have slaved for him long enough, and now I
shall have everything done for me. No one
would believe what a heart that boy has. Positively,
I am afraid of what he may think of doing
now he is rich.'</p>

<p>'It is very nice to see young people like
that,' said Lady Winter pleasantly. 'Reginald
is wonderfully soft-hearted too. But I have
tried to bring him up reasonably, and I do believe
he has no crazes. Seriously, I don't think
your boy could have a more suitable friend just
now. You see Reggy has sown his wild oats. I
am bound to confess that the crop was innocent
enough, but it cost me something. Now he is
as steady as old Time.'</p>

<p>'I am very glad that the two boys should be
together,' said Mrs. Gregory simply.</p>

<p>Here, to the annoyance of Lady Winter, who
had more to say about Tom, Lady Elton and two
of her girls, Maud and Trixy, were shown in.</p>

<p>Lady Elton had been feeling a little nervous
all the morning, wondering what she should say;
but the moment she saw Mrs. Gregory all her
nervousness fled. Her sweet face flushed a rosy
red, as she went forward impulsively, holding
out her two hands. 'Dear friend!' she said,
'we are so glad&mdash;so very glad&mdash;to hear of your
good fortune.'</p>

<p>'I knew you would be,' said Mrs. Gregory,
and, forgetting the dignity of their respective
positions&mdash;a General's wife and a millionaire's
mother&mdash;they kissed each other again and again,
like two schoolgirls.</p>

<p>Maud meanwhile stood aside, and waited
her turn. She was a handsome girl of the aggressive
type. No one would pass her over in a
crowd. She had flashing brown eyes, a profusion
of silky brown hair, which she wore, after the
fashion of the time, in a sparkling beaded net,
regular features, and a determined mouth and
chin.</p>

<p>Maud was never nervous. She considered
herself equal to every conceivable emergency.
When Mrs. Gregory turned to address her she
had her little speech ready. 'We were delighted
with father's good news last night,' she
said, smiling prettily, 'and we hope you and Tom
will be very happy.'</p>

<p>'"We" includes me,' said Trixy. 'Maud
speaks so well, you know. We always let her
speak for us. But I really am tremendously glad.'</p>

<p>'Thank you, dears,' said Mrs. Gregory. 'I
love to feel that you are glad. We are so like
one family that I feel as if it ought to be good
news to you all. And now,' looking towards Lady
Winter, 'what do you all say? Shall we sit out
on the lawn until tea? It is just pleasant now.'</p>

<p>'If you ask me, I should like nothing better,'
said Lady Winter, rising gracefully.</p>

<p>'But where is he&mdash;Tom, I mean?' said Lady
Elton, as they went out. 'I heard he had come
back from town.'</p>

<p>'Reginald has carried him off for a smoke
and a chat,' said Lady Winter. 'I expect they
will join us presently. But young men will have
their quiet hour in the evening.'</p>

<p>'I see them!' cried Trixy. 'They are just
outside the summer-house. I'll run and tell
Tom you are here, mother.'</p>

<p>'No, no!' and 'Wouldn't it be rather a
pity?' came simultaneously from Lady Elton
and Lady Winter. But Trixy did not hear
them. She knew instinctively that her friend
Tom wanted deliverance, and she was off across
the garden with the speed of a lapwing.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So far the conversation had been rather a
one-sided business. Sir Reginald had talked.
He was giving information. Tom had listened.
He had heard of magnificent chambers in town
going for a song; of shootings and fishings to be
had for very little more than the asking; of
horses perfect in wind and limb, concerning
whose purchase Sir Reginald would be glad to
interest himself; of cellars of priceless wines
waiting for a buyer; of furniture, china, pictures,
bric-à-brac to be had at phenomenally low
prices&mdash;of a world, in fact, that was offering itself
for purchase. The curious thing was that none
of these interesting pieces of intelligence seemed
to move him. He sat, as Sir Reginald said afterwards,
like a wooden image, gazing at nothing.
He would not even take the excellent cigar he
was offered. Then, just as his companion hoped
he was becoming a little interested, the wild
little Elton girl rushed down upon them, and his
opportunity was at an end.</p>

<p>Tom showed plenty of animation to Trixy;
and when he heard that Lady Elton had come
over to the cottage with her, he said he would
go back to the upper lawn and see her. 'What
will you do, Winter?' he said.</p>

<p>'Oh, thanks. Don't mind me. I'll finish
my cigar out here, and join the rest of you later,'
said Sir Reginald.</p>

<p>The rest of the evening passed pleasantly by.
Tea, which was a composite meal such as women
love, proved a complete success. Nothing could
have been prettier, Lady Winter said graciously.</p>

<p>After tea Tom devoted himself to Lady Elton,
Sir Reginald made Maud happy by talking down
to her sleepily, Lady Winter chatted amiably
to Mrs. Gregory, and Trixy teased everyone in
turn.</p>

<p>Presently came some music&mdash;the drawing-room
music of that period, which was before the
days of amateur artists. Maud, thinking of handsome,
languid Sir Reginald, warbled a sentimental
love ditty; Mrs. Gregory was induced to play an
old-fashioned fantasia; and Trixy rattled her last
piano piece, making her mother hot and cold by
turns as she stumbled over the difficult passages.</p>

<p>The Winters left early. She was enjoying
herself so much, Lady Winter said, that she
<i>could</i> stay all night; but she was bound not to
keep late hours. She was going to have some
visitors&mdash;one in particular, whom she believed
they would like to meet, and she mentioned an
early day for tea at their house, begging Lady
Elton to come too, and to bring Maud and dear
little Trixy with her.</p>

<p>To her son she said as they walked home:
'A little of that kind of thing goes a long way. I
wonder if those dear good people will ever learn
to be rich?'</p>

<p>'Tom won't. He is a regular muff,' said Sir
Reginald. 'I shall take no more trouble about
him.'</p>

<p>'Oh! but you will, dear,' said his mother
sweetly. 'For Mrs. Gregory's sake. She is such
a dear good soul! Not quite&mdash;well, you know
what I mean; but very nice&mdash;' and she added
after a pause, for her son had not thought it
necessary to answer this appeal, 'I have written
to Vivien. I rather think she will be with us
to-morrow.'</p>

<p>'I must say, mother,' said Sir Reginald, 'that
you don't allow the grass to grow under your
feet. I shall be surprised if even Vivien, clever
as she is, gets anything out of that moonstruck
youth.'</p>

<p>'Well, we shall see,' said Lady Winter.</p>

<p>In the cottage the departure of the Winters
brought a certain sense of relief, more especially
to two of the party, Tom and Lady Elton.</p>

<p>There was a strong sympathy between these
two. Sometimes, indeed, it made Tom's mother
jealous to see her son hang about her old friend
as he was doing to-night. After she had watched
them for some time wistfully, she said, her voice
quivering:</p>

<p>'Haven't you appropriated Lady Elton long
enough, Tom? Come over here and entertain
Maud and Trixy, and let me have her for a few
moments.'</p>

<p>'I am afraid I am not in an amusing mood,'
said Tom, rising with reluctance.</p>

<p>'When you are next in an amusing mood
perhaps you will let us know,' said Trixy saucily.</p>

<p>'Those are things people ought to find out
for themselves,' he said, taking a seat beside her.</p>

<p>'How can they,' said the child, 'if there are
no indications&mdash;&mdash;?'</p>

<p>'Which means that you have always found
me dull.'</p>

<p>'No, no, no. But I can't say you are ever
very funny.'</p>

<p>'You see, Trixy, you give no one a chance.'</p>

<p>'Bravo, Tom! not bad for a beginner,' cried
Trixy, clapping her hands. 'Maud'&mdash;to her
elder sister&mdash;'how <i>ridiculously</i> grave you look!'</p>

<p>'I see nothing to laugh at,' said Maud, whereupon
the incorrigible child folded her hands and
looked down her nose demurely. The copy of
Maud's expression and attitude was so good that
Tom could not help laughing.</p>

<p>'Stop a little longer; the young people are
just beginning to enjoy themselves,' said Mrs.
Gregory to Lady Elton.</p>

<p>'Thank you very much, but I am afraid we
must really go,' she answered. 'The General
will surely be at home by this. He took Grace
up the river this afternoon.'</p>

<p>'And he wouldn't take anyone else,' said
Trixy, who was still smarting under her grievance.
'I am <i>sure</i> they were going to talk secrets.
Good-bye, Tom.'</p>

<p>'I mean to take you home as usual, Trixy.'</p>

<p>'Pray don't,' said Maud icily. 'It's only a
step.'</p>

<p>A peal of laughter from Trixy greeted her
speech.</p>

<p>'Maud,' she cried, 'you are too funny for
anything. You will freeze us up to nothing. I
feel the process beginning. Don't you, Tom?'</p>

<p>'Trixy, you wild little creature, do you mean
to stay all night?' said Lady Elton, who was
waiting hooded and cloaked in the verandah.</p>

<p>'No, mother, here I am,' said Trixy, 'and
Maud is following me. Maud can't walk very
quickly, you know. Good-night, dearest, sweetest
Mrs. Gregory. Tom&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Tom will go with you, of course,' said Mrs.
Gregory. 'Good-night, dears. Come and see
me again soon. Yes, the night air is a little chilly,
so I will shut the door. You may say good-night
to me too, Tom. I am tired, and I think I shall
go to my room at once.'</p>

<p>The door of the cottage shut, and all but
Mrs. Gregory went out into the throbbing silence
of the summer night. Its enchantment made
even wild little Trixy quiet for a few moments.
As she looked up and saw the little moon, half
entangled in a web of rainbow-tinted clouds,
floating like a spirit in the dark spaces of the
starlit sky, she said in a stifled whisper that
she didn't in the least wonder that looking at
the moon made people feel sentimental. In the
next instant, however, sentiment was put to
flight.</p>

<p>A cheerful, sonorous voice, which they all
knew, came ringing across the lawn, while from
under the shadows of the witch-elms a little band
of figures appeared. The General, and Grace,
and Lucy, and Mildred had come out in search of
them.</p>

<p>'Good evening, Tom; good evening, everybody,'
said the General. 'We began to think
you meant to keep my lady altogether, so we
came out in a body to fetch her back.'</p>

<p>'It was unnecessary. I was taking the
greatest care of her,' said Tom; 'but I am glad
to see you all the same, General.'</p>

<p>'Thank you, my boy, thank you,' said the
General cheerfully. 'Well, good-night to you!'
And then he tucked his wife's hand under his
arm&mdash;he was her true lover still, as he would be
to the end of his days&mdash;whistled up the girls as
if, stately Maud was saying to herself discontentedly,
they were a pack of harriers, and
started off at a quick pace for their own gate.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Tom fell behind with Grace. He did not
know exactly how he had managed it, or whether
any management at all had been required; but
so it was that when they came out into the moonlit
road, he and Grace were together. He looked
down upon her with a beating heart. Words
came thronging to his lips, but he could not
speak them. She seemed to have moved further
away from him than ever. This white light of
moon and stars in which she walked was, to his
excited fancy, like the mystic world that was
her home, and she in her light garments, her
pale gold hair all ruffled by the breeze, making
an aureole like a saint's halo round her beautiful
face, was as lovely, and alas! as unapproachable
as a vision. Silently they go along the interval
of road that separated Mrs. Gregory's grounds
from those of General Elton. And now they
are in the little dark shrubbery behind the lawn
and rose garden.</p>

<p>Here Tom, who has been sighing like a furnace,
pulls up in desperation, for he feels that
his opportunity is slipping away from him.</p>

<p>'Are you tired?' he says in a shaken voice.</p>

<p>'Oh, no!' answers Grace, only a little more
firmly. 'I am not at all tired.'</p>

<p>'Then won't you come down to the river for
a few moments?' he says pleadingly. 'It looks
so pretty in this light.'</p>

<p>His heart is thumping against his ribs, and
there is a singing in his ears which nearly deafens
him. He hears indeed so imperfectly that he is
on the point of apologising humbly for having
made a preposterous suggestion when he realises
that Grace has fallen in with it, that she is, in
fact, leading him to a little tangled path through
the shrubbery that leads straight to the lower
lawn. 'Mind how you go!' says the sweet
voice. 'It is dark here, and the branches are
low. To the right; now to the left. Trixy
calls this the maze.'</p>

<p>In a few moments they emerge from the
shrubbery, cross an interval of lawn, and stand
on the bank above the river, at the very spot
where Tom saw his vision of the night before.</p>

<p>'Isn't it lovely?' says Grace, in a low voice.
'Come here, under the willows, where the
shadows are deep, and look down!'</p>

<p>'How dark and silent it is!' says Tom.</p>

<p>'Silent, but never still. I don't know how it
is,' says Grace, with a little sigh, 'but flowing
water always makes me feel tired.'</p>

<p>'It is the constant movement. I have felt
that too. But sit down, darling. Don't look at
it&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>She interrupts him a little impatiently. 'No;
you don't understand. It is not <i>that</i> weariness;
it is of the mind. I think of life; how it is going
on, always, always. No rest, not for a single
moment; dying, being born, loving, hating,
thinking, fighting, suffering, sinning. It is terrible.'</p>

<p>'But it is beautiful too, Grace.'</p>

<p>'It may be, or perhaps indifferent. To one
here and there; one like the river that receives
but cannot give.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean, Grace?'</p>

<p>'I don't know that I quite know myself,' she
says, wearily. 'But look at the river. It is
very old, isn't it? I imagine how, when it began
to flow, the big primeval world, with its forests
and monsters, was about it&mdash;ages upon ages&mdash;and
then came men and their inventions&mdash;huts
and houses, and castles, and palaces, and cities,
rising and falling as the river flows on, the old,
old river. And sometimes I think of the dead
it has hidden, of the tragedies it has seen, of the
miseries it has stilled. And <i>it</i> is always the
same; smiling in the sunlight, sleeping in the
shadow, making pictures of the trees and flowers
on its banks. Could one hope to like that?'</p>

<p>'But we do not see what the river does,
Grace.'</p>

<p>'Some of us do. We carry in our hearts the
passion and pain of the past. I had rather not,
much rather. Sometimes I feel as if it would
kill me, and then I long to be as this water is,
smiling and insensible. But when they have
touched you once,' says the girl, her voice vibrating
strangely, 'you know that you can never
be as you have been; never, never!' She turns
her back to the river. 'Come back to the
house,' she says abruptly. 'I hear my sisters
laughing.'</p>

<p>'Must you go? Will you not give me two
or three moments? I have so much to say to
you. So much' (smiling a little piteously) 'that
I scarcely know where to begin. Grace, dearest,
my life is flowing on like the water in the river,
and this little hand of yours can turn it whatever
way it pleases.'</p>

<p>'Hush, hush!' says Grace. 'You must not
say such things.'</p>

<p>'I must, for it is true. Grace! Grace! I
love you.' He pauses. The light of the moon
is veiled by clouds, so that he cannot see her
face; but she is silent, and silence sometimes
means more than speech. 'I am not worthy of
you'&mdash;his words leap out fervently&mdash;'so unworthy
that it is little short of madness to imagine
you might care for me. But I love you. I
know'&mdash;with a catching back of the breath&mdash;'there
is nothing strange in that. Everyone
who has seen you must love you. But I think&mdash;I
think&mdash;no one will ever love you as I do.
My heart, my soul, my life; everything I have
and am are yours, if you will only take them.'</p>

<p>And here suddenly he stops, the eloquent
words frozen on his lips. Grace has covered her
face with her hands. 'What is it?' he whispers
very low. He would draw one of those little
hands down and cover it with kisses; but he
dares not. In the next instant he is trembling.
She has lifted her sad eyes; she is looking at
him, looking at him&mdash;oh, God!&mdash;with the very
eyes of his vision.</p>

<p>'I wish you had told me this before,' she
says, brokenly. 'Is it only now you know that
you love me?'</p>

<p>'No, no. I have known it always, the first
moment I saw you. But why, in the name of
heaven, do you ask me such a question?'</p>

<p>'It was a foolish question'&mdash;she is trying
hard to speak calmly. 'Forget it.'</p>

<p>'I cannot, Grace; for pity's sake tell me!'</p>

<p>'Because, dear Tom&mdash;I will call you so this
once&mdash;<i>then</i> it might have been; <i>now</i> it cannot.'</p>

<p>'You might have accepted my love, oh,
Grace!'&mdash;he tries to seize her hands, but she
will not give them.</p>

<p>'Not now, not now,' she says. 'It is too
late.'</p>

<p>'But how can it be?' cries the poor fellow
wildly. 'Grace, you are torturing me. Two
days ago&mdash;such a short time&mdash;we seemed to understand
one another quite well. I would have
spoken then, but I had nothing to offer you. It
was for your sake, darling, because I could not&mdash;dared
not&mdash;run the risk of dragging you into
poverty. My circumstances have changed, nothing
else. And, dear, if you object to being
rich, there is no need for us to spend our wealth
as rich people generally do. For all I know I
may be only steward of my inheritance. To-night
when I leave you I am to read the papers which
I believe will give me the real wish of him who
left it to me. Grace, I shall go to them with
such hope, such heart, such courage, if I take
your promise with me. Answer me, my darling,
may I believe, may I hope, that whatever I may
be called upon to do may be done, not by me
alone, but by you and me together?'</p>

<p>That question has never been answered.
Grace had turned away from him. Suddenly
she cries out and grasps his arm convulsively.
'Look! look! What is that?'</p>

<p>For an instant horror holds him spellbound.
In the next he is rushing headlong across the
garden, crying out 'Fire! Fire!</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h5><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a></h5>

<h4>AN IRREPARABLE LOSS</h4>


<p>The Gregorys' cottage was on fire. While
Grace ran back to the house calling her father,
Tom leapt over the fence, ran along the road,
and tore into their garden, where, to his great
relief, he at once saw his mother and the two
servants. The girls were weeping and wringing
their hands. Mrs. Gregory looked dazed.
'Thank God that you are all right!' cried Tom,
as he swept past her towards the burning
house.</p>

<p>'Come back!' cried his mother. 'I beg you,
I command you!' But Tom had already gone.</p>

<p>The General joined her. 'All right so far!'
he said. 'The fire is all on one side. We may
save the cottage yet. How did it happen?'
turning to the shrinking maids.</p>

<p>'I was going to bed,' sobbed one.</p>

<p>'But if I hadn't been up,' said the other,
'goodness knows what mightn't have happened!
It was like this here, sir&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Go to the General's, both of you,' interrupted
Mrs. Gregory impatiently. 'General, I
am to blame, and only I. I put down a lighted
candle on the window-sill in the hall and forgot
it. The curtains caught.'</p>

<p>'Just so. Those new-fangled decorations
are like tinder. I've said so again and again,'
said the General, grimly triumphant. 'It's a
good thing you got out safely. Here are Grace
and my wife. Now take my advice and go
quickly to our house with them. I'll look after
Tom.'</p>

<p>'Come with us, dear Mrs. Gregory,' said
Grace.</p>

<p>'The General will do all he can,' said Lady
Elton.</p>

<p>By this time the garden was alive. People
were hurrying up from every direction: water
was being poured over the roof of the cottage,
and all sorts of things&mdash;from tables and chairs to
millinery&mdash;were being flung out of the windows.
'I can't go in till I know that Tom is safe,'
cried Mrs. Gregory.</p>

<p>'Why, here he is!' said the General, 'and
by Jove! he looks as if he had seen a ghost!'</p>

<p>Tom carried a lantern, the light of which,
streaming upwards, showed his face as white as
death. He strode up to the little group, and,
taking no notice of the ladies, seized the General
by the shoulder. 'Robbery has been done,' he
said hoarsely.</p>

<p>'What? money! jewels! Lady Elton, for
God's sake take Mrs. Gregory away!' said the
General. 'Now,' as the three ladies moved
away slowly, 'don't rave; but tell me plainly
what has happened!'</p>

<p>'My desk has been ransacked and papers
of incalculable value to me have been taken
out.'</p>

<p>'Taken out? You are sure of that?'</p>

<p>'I am positive. I put them away in my
escritoire. It has been forced open.'</p>

<p>'Anything besides papers gone?'</p>

<p>'Nothing. I put a twenty-pound note there&mdash;the
price of my last design. It is there still.'</p>

<p>'And these papers&mdash;what are they?'</p>

<p>'I don't know. That is the cruel part of it.
They were given to me by Mr. Cherry as explaining
my inheritance, and I was to have
looked over them to-night. But we are wasting
time. Come back with me to the house and
watch the people there. I have a suspicion
that the papers were seized and the house fired
by the same hand.'</p>

<p>'Impossible, Tom! I know how the fire
arose.'</p>

<p>They had been hurrying back to the house;
but, on hearing this, Tom pulled up. 'You
know!' he ejaculated. 'How can that be?'</p>

<p>'My dear boy, for heaven's sake don't be so
melodramatic,' said the General tartly. 'You
will be accusing <i>me</i> of stealing your papers next.
The fire broke out in the simplest way. Your
mother put down her candle on the window-sill
in the hall, and those muslin curtains of yours,
against which I have preached till I am tired,
caught fire. Now don't, like a good fellow, stare
at me so! I am repeating your mother's own
words.'</p>

<p>'Where is my mother?' asked Tom.</p>

<p>'She is with Lady Elton, and there she shall
remain for the present. I refuse to permit you
to ask her a single question to-night.'</p>

<p>They were, by this time, in the midst of the
little crowd that surrounded the house. Water
was still playing over it; but the flames were
dead. 'Pretty safe now?' said the General,
addressing one of the policemen.</p>

<p>'Yes, sir; and we saved a goodish lot of
things.'</p>

<p>'So I see. Any strangers about?'</p>

<p>'No, General; not a single soul. I was
up here from the first. Do Mr. Gregory
think&mdash;&mdash;?'</p>

<p>'Mr. Gregory has missed some valuable
papers.'</p>

<p>'If they were on this side, General, 'taint
wonderful like.'</p>

<p>'They were on the other&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'We must see after it to-morrow,' interrupted
Tom hastily; and then, raising his voice: 'I am
much obliged to you all for helping me to-night,
and to-morrow, if you come to me, I will reward
you for your trouble. I believe there is nothing
more to be done now.'</p>

<p>'Two of the police had better stay on the
premises. There are all sorts of things lying
about,' said the General. 'You, Tom, will come
back with me.'</p>

<p>'I am much obliged to you, General; but I
think I had rather not. My own room is perfectly
safe, I believe.'</p>

<p>'But the furniture is out, isn't it?'</p>

<p>'No; there was nothing of value but the
papers; and, for reasons of my own, I had it
left as it was. Good-night, General.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So at last Tom was alone. He had given up
his lantern to the policeman; but he would not
strike a light. He sat on the side of his bed,
listening while the sounds of the many footsteps
died away, and gazing out into the darkness,
which was strangely empty to him. At last,
being utterly worn out, he flung himself down
on the bed and slept. He awoke early. Of
course his first thought was the papers, to the
loss of which he could not reconcile himself
tamely. Thinking it just possible that he might
have been mistaken in supposing he had left
them in his writing-drawer, he turned the room
upside down in search of them. It was all to
no purpose. After a few wild moments of alternating
hope and despair, he made up his mind
that they would not be found in the house.</p>

<p>He dressed and went down into the garden,
which was choked up with <i>débris</i> from the
gutted rooms. His mother's servants, under
whose directions some of the furniture was being
carried in, were there already. He questioned
them closely about the night before, wishing
particularly to know if any stranger had been
hanging about during the afternoon or evening.
But they could give him no satisfaction.</p>

<p>He went on into the Eltons' garden. Early
as it was, the General was out. Dressed in
morning <i>déshabille</i> he was sitting on the lawn,
taking the early cup of tea which strengthened
him for his work amongst his plants, while
Yaseen Khan, his Indian servant, stood behind
him, holding up a white umbrella.</p>

<p>The General welcomed Tom warmly. 'Good
morning, my dear boy!' he said. 'Got over last
night's shock, I hope. Sit down! Yaseen Khan,
another cup. Yes, I insist. No sedative like
tea.'</p>

<p>'Can I see my mother?' said Tom.</p>

<p>'Not yet, I am sure. She was very much
excited last night, and seems to have had difficulty
in resting. The last I heard was that she
was asleep and not to be disturbed. You may
as well take things quietly. Papers found?'</p>

<p>'No, General.'</p>

<p>'Dear! dear! And you say they are important?'</p>

<p>'They are of the deepest, the most incalculable
importance to me.'</p>

<p>'You don't mean to say so? I wonder Cherry
let them out of his hands.'</p>

<p>'But they were mine&mdash;the legacy of the dead
man who has enriched me. I hoped to find his
wishes, his instructions.'</p>

<p>'In fact,' said the General with a bland
smile, 'they had no value except for you. Set
your mind at rest, then. They will certainly be
found. In the meantime here is your cup.
Cream? Sugar? Now then, Yaseen Khan&mdash;that
fellow is moving like a snail to-day. Don't stare,
you son of an owl, but bring up that small table.
Understand English? Of course he does. See
him when Trixy-sahib speaks to him.' A smile
had overspread Yaseen Khan's passive countenance,
and he began to hop about briskly. 'There!
her very name is enough,' said the General. And
thereupon, beginning with Trixy, he talked about
his little girls, giving anecdotes illustrative of
their peculiar ways of meeting discipline, and of
his own wise and subtle methods of bringing
them to what he was pleased to call reason.</p>

<p>Grace came out while this tirade was in progress,
and she caught the words: 'A firm hand,
Tom. That's the secret. Let them know you
mean what you say.'</p>

<p>'Are you making Mr. Gregory believe that
you are a tyrant, dad?' she said, putting her
arms round his neck and kissing him first on
the forehead and then on the cheeks. 'Because&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Now, pull up, young woman,' said the
General, winking mischievously at Tom, 'or I
shall say that you are showing off before our
young friend here.'</p>

<p>'Father!' Grace was erect at once, with
blazing cheeks and eyes.</p>

<p>'You see,' said the General, in high delight.
'That's how I do it.'</p>

<p>Grace laughed and kissed him again. 'You
are the dearest old goose in all the world, father,'
she said. 'How you ever manage to make your
men obey you is a mystery to me. They are
afraid of him, Tom. Can you imagine it? I
can't.'</p>

<p>'Another cup, Yaseen Khan!' said the
General. 'We must stop this girl somehow.'</p>

<p>'Not a cup for me, dear,' said Grace. 'I
came out with a message. Mother and I are
having tea with Mrs. Gregory. She heard Tom's
voice and she wants to see him.'</p>

<p>'Thank you. I was very anxious to see her,'
said Tom, rising.</p>

<p>'But mother says you must be sure to say
nothing to excite Mrs. Gregory,' said Grace, as
they walked together towards the house. 'Her
nerves seem a little unstrung by the shock.'</p>

<p>Tom promised to be careful, and he was
shown into a room where he found his mother
sitting up in bed, a fine Indian shawl of Lady
Elton's thrown round her shoulders. She did
not look ill&mdash;in fact, there was a brighter colour
than usual on her face, while the only sign of
the excitement of which Grace had spoken was
in her eyes, which shone curiously.</p>

<p>'Why, mother,' said Tom, stooping to kiss
her. 'I don't believe you are any worse for the
shock.'</p>

<p>'No, I don't think I am,' she answered, looking
at him fondly. 'It is such a relief that we are
all safe. Did you hear that it was my fault?'</p>

<p>'I heard that you thought it was, mother.'</p>

<p>'But I should like to tell you how it really
came about,' she said a little eagerly. 'I told
you I was going to my room. Well! I lighted
my candle and was on my way across the hall
when I heard all the voices in the garden. I
wanted to see if Grace was there, and knew I
should know her by her light dress, so I put
down the candle and went up to my room in
the dark. And then, dear, I don't quite know
what happened to me. I suppose I was dreaming
about you, and dreaming of dear Grace too.
I must have fallen into a dream or trance, for I
certainly knew nothing until the servants came
rushing out with cries of "fire." At that moment
I remembered the candle on the window-sill,
but, of course, too late. That's all. An
accident, and happily, as Lady Elton says, no
very serious consequences. Just imagine what
we would have felt if it had happened a week
ago.'</p>

<p>'I wish it had,' said Tom,'and then my papers
might not have gone.'</p>

<p>'Papers?' echoed his mother, her voice
fluttering strangely. 'Are they burnt, Tom?'</p>

<p>'Speak of them another time,' said Lady
Elton.</p>

<p>'Remember your promise,' whispered Grace.</p>

<p>The colour had leapt to Mrs. Gregory's face,
and her eyes, which glittered feverishly, were
fixed upon her son.</p>

<p>'They can't have been taken away!' she
whispered. 'Who would? Are you sure&mdash;are
you sure they were not burnt?'</p>

<p>'Of course they were burnt,' said Tom, bending
over her in great alarm. 'What else could
it be? If you excite yourself like this, you will
be ill, mother.'</p>

<p>'Oh, no!' she said. 'It is all right now.'</p>

<p>The excitement had died away as soon as it
had arisen. She fell back upon her pillows, pale
and smiling. Tom left the room relieved on her
account, but feeling more baffled than ever about
his papers.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h5><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a></h5>

<h4>THE RAJAH'S HEIR SPEAKS FOR HIMSELF</h4>


<p>It is at this point that the troubles of the
writer of the above record began. For Thomas
Gregory&mdash;the Tom whom he had been following
through these curious vicissitudes of condition
and fortune&mdash;became suddenly dim to him. He
heard rumours indeed&mdash;the rumours which were
circulating in the neighbourhood at the time,
but these were vague and contradictory. Moreover,
they touched only the surface of Tom's
life. That he tried, or pretended to try, to find
the lost papers; that he was unsuccessful; that
he passed through a period of severe mental depression;
that his mother, feeling alarmed at his
condition, tried her utmost to make him marry
and settle down; that her wishes were frustrated,
some said by his wilfulness, others by the pride
and folly of the girl he loved, who, having been
twitted about her attentions to a wealthy man,
was piqued into holding Tom at arm's length; and
that, at length, to his mother's great distress, he
resolved to go out to India; all this the writer has
heard from those who were living in Surbiton at
the time. There were rumours, too, of spiritualistic
visitations both to the boy and to the girl.
Those were before the days when spirits played
their pranks, for a monetary consideration, before
public audiences; and some said it was in obedience
to these bodiless voices that they kept apart.</p>

<p>But all this is mere guess-work. I know,
however, as a certain fact, having heard it on
no less authority than Lady Winter's, that Tom's
first care, after he came into his property, was
to surround his mother with all the comforts and
luxuries that money can give. A pretty house,
which became later one of the show places of the
neighbourhood, was built for her after his own
design; and, in the meantime, she had carriages
and horses, and good dress and good living, with,
what was more to her than all her other luxuries
put together, the opportunity of doing boundless
kindnesses to her friends, and of exercising a
large and benignant charity. Had it not been
for her son's eccentricities, which were more
marked after he came into his inheritance than
they had been before, Mrs. Gregory, the world
says, would have been perfectly happy.</p>

<p>Lady Winter and her son, neither of whom
had the least taint of peculiarity, did their best
to bring round the young heir, so at least I have
heard, to more healthy views of life; and Mr.
Cherry backed them up with his wise counsels;
but Tom declined absolutely to do anything like
other people.</p>

<p>Now this I could understand; but when I
heard of other things&mdash;of the flirtation, for instance,
between him and handsome Vivien Leigh,
who, it was reported, had thrown off a former
lover for his sake, of days and nights when no
one, not even his mother, knew where he was&mdash;eclipses
from which he would emerge with a white
face and sunken eyes that made his friends shake
their heads dolefully over him; of some of his
doings at Surbiton, and in particular the magnificent
river fête that he gave just before he left
for India, and the fame of which lingers in the
neighbourhood to this day&mdash;then, I confess, I
was surprised, beginning at last to wonder if <i>my</i>
Thomas Gregory did really exist, as if he was not
only a dream of my imagination. Various other
reports, dealing mostly with his life in India, some
of them curiously minute, had fallen under my
notice; but they did not seem quite to fit in one
with the other.</p>

<p>Then came the difficulty of selection. I had
formed my own conception of his character&mdash;a
conception seriously shaken already by what I
had heard of him in Surbiton. Would not my
selection, if I tried to choose amongst the materials
offered to me, be coloured both by the conception
I had previously formed and by the shock it had
sustained, so that the image produced would be
distorted, and, in no sense, answering to reality?</p>

<p>I was in this state of perplexity&mdash;on the point
indeed of giving up the task of tracing the fortunes
of the rajah's heir, when, by the mediation
of a friend, who was anxious that the curious
story should not be lost, a diary, kept spasmodically
by Tom himself for some years, was placed
in my hands, with liberty, under certain restrictions,
to use it according to my own judgment.</p>

<p>It has been of inestimable service to me, not
only in filling up blanks that would otherwise
have remained vacant, but also as giving such a
mental image of the man himself as no one but
himself could draw. It is partly with a view of
presenting the first outlines as it were of this picture&mdash;partly
because they form a good introduction
to the stirring events of his Indian life, that
I have decided to give, almost as they stand, the
daily jottings in Tom's diary during his first
voyage to India.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>S.S. 'Patagonia,' <i>September</i>, 1856.&mdash;I will do
as I have been advised. I will write down my
experiences, and some of the strange thoughts
and contradictory impulses that are constantly
with me. It is possible that in this way my
purposes and aims may become more distinct to
myself. I don't think there could be a better
moment than this for beginning my record. In
the little state-room which for the next few weeks
is to be my home there is a perfect quietness.
I can hear the movement of feet up above, and
the throbbing of the engines as they beat the
water, but there is nothing else. After the excitement
of the last few days it seems like a
blessed lull&mdash;a pause in my life.</p>

<p>It is three months now since I heard of the
change that had come into my life. I look back
upon those months as I might on a tumultuous
stream that had borne me on its surface. Hurried
from one mental and physical sensation to
another, I have not had time so much as to
think. I have felt like a foam-bubble on a wave,
a toy ship in a storm. Before the tumult begins
again, as it will, I suppose, when my feet touch
the opposite shore, I must try to realise and
define my position.</p>

<p>I am heir of my cousin, the rajah of Gumilcund,
and I am going out to take possession of
my inheritance. Besides land and money he left
me the succession of his ideas, which succession
I have lost through my own cowardly delay, and
liability to be guided by the <i>ignis fatuus</i> of passionate
impulse. It is this succession which I
am seeking to recover. From the lips of the
men who knew him I may learn something of
what my papers would have taught me. Meantime,
and with a view to taking the best advantages
of my opportunities, I am studying the
Oriental languages, and trying my hardest to
grapple with the difficulties of the Indian philosophies
and religions. Until I know what my
task will be I have made up my mind not to
take up any strong personal interest into my life.
I will live for this, and for nothing else.</p>

<p>Sometimes&mdash;I will confess it here&mdash;there have
been moments when my nature has rebelled
wildly against its self-imposed restrictions&mdash;moments
when I have forgotten that the inheritance
came to me with conditions which I must
understand and fulfil before I can so much as
know that it belongs to me&mdash;when I have craved
passionately for the enjoyments of the senses.</p>

<p>Such a moment was that of my river-fête&mdash;Yes&mdash;and
even now, although I know how illusive
are the brief, sickly-sweet pleasures of the
senses&mdash;my pulses will throb as I look back
upon it. A night that seems like a century!
Beautiful Vivien Leigh, the designer of the festival,
as she was its queen, sat beside me. I remember
a moment when she and I and some
others were floating down the river on a painted
barge. She was dressed in a robe whose colour
was like that of ruddy flame; the white glitter of
diamonds lighted up her dark hair; her wonderful,
witch-like eyes, resting on mine, were drawing
my soul away. I was close to her&mdash;I was going
to speak&mdash;when&mdash;Oh! Grace! Grace! this once
let me write your name. It was your boat, all
lighted and dressed with streamers, that passed
us by. You, my dearest, were there, with the
rudder-strings in your hands, and your sisters&mdash;stately
Maud and gay little Trixy, and gentle
Lucy and Mildred&mdash;held the oars. How lovely
you all looked in your white dresses! One of
you called to me&mdash;it was Trixy I think&mdash;and I
left my flame-coloured lady, and stepped down
amongst you, and you gave me a pair of oars,
and as I grasped them, carrying the boat forward
by a vigorous stroke, I knew that the witchery
had lost its power; that I was once more free.</p>

<p>I saw Mr. Cherry the day before I started.
He is an admirable person, perfectly sincere in
his creed and in his life; but how singularly
illogical! I believe he thanks heaven for the
loss of my papers, feeling convinced that it came
about in answer to prayers of his own, for my
salvation and guidance. He warns me, too, on
scriptural authority, against spirits that peep
and mutter. And yet, because I think that the
curtain which hides the invisible from our
senses has been once lifted for me, he calls me a
mystic. 'My dear sir,' I could not help saying
to him one day, 'I do believe that at this
present moment you are far more a mystic
than I am.' Mr. Cherry's keen head and clear
judgment, when matters of business are in
question, have, however, been exceedingly valuable
to me. He has advised me concerning my
correspondence with the Lieutenant-Governor,
mapped out my route in India, and given me
the names and addresses of those known to him
in the East as the chief friends and associates of
my cousin, the rajah.</p>

<p>&mdash;I have just been up on deck seeing the
last of the English coast. We are off the Isle of
Wight, where we stopped, for a few moments, to
put off the Channel pilot. It is late in the afternoon,
the atmosphere misty and irradiated with
the hues of sunset, so that we seem to be floating
in a rosy haze, through which the pale
green shores of the land we are leaving gleam
faintly. There is scarcely any wind, and the sea
is as smooth as a lake in midsummer.</p>

<p>&mdash;I have been fortunate enough to find a
person on board who can help me in my Persian
and Sanskrit studies. He is, or seems to be,
a pure Indian, by name Chunder Singh, such a
handsome fellow, tall, well put together, with a
face whose fine cast and quiet dignified expression,
impress one at once! This afternoon
I saw him looking at me with interest, whereupon
I spoke, and finding he understood English
well, talked with him for some time. I have
spoken about him to the Captain, who says he
is needy, and will, no doubt, be glad to give me
lessons.</p>

<p>&mdash;Chunder Singh has met my advances with
a gentleness and benignity that have charmed
me inexpressibly. He was so princely in his
manners that I felt half ashamed of offering
him money for the help which he seemed so
ready to give me; but when, with English awkwardness,
I blurted out that, if he gave me
lessons he should be adequately paid for them,
he accepted my offer with a grace and dignity
that caused me to blush over my own hesitation.
This morning we met for the first time over my
books with the crabbed characters to which I
am extraordinarily glad to return. Chunder
Singh, I am sure, will prove an admirable
teacher.</p>

<p>&mdash;We are in the Bay of Biscay. There has
been a considerable swell on all day, and the
decks have been empty of passengers; but
Chunder Singh and I have kept our feet. I
like him more and more as the days go by; but
I confess he puzzles me exceedingly. I think he
is more than a professor of Eastern languages.
His conversation, although free from any sort
of bombast, leads me to believe that he has
occupied a superior social position, and he has
certainly mixed with men of mark. Then I
fancy I can detect in his manner a peculiar
anxiety about me&mdash;an interest, in fact, stronger
than our respective positions and the period of
our acquaintanceship seems to warrant.</p>

<p>I mentioned this to Colonel Trent&mdash;an intimate
friend of General Elton's&mdash;who is travelling
with us, and I put down his answer because it
may be useful to me hereafter. I must be on
my guard, he says, against inferring too much
from manner in the East. The educated Asiatic
has a courteousness far exceeding ours. We,
when we wish to be friendly, speak to our companions
about ourselves. He waits for his
friend's confidences, and listens to them with
the most courteous attention, which generally,
however, is mere manner.</p>

<p>'I have spent twenty-five years in the East,'
said Colonel Trent. 'I am not without acuteness,
and I believe I know the Asiatic better
than most Europeans. Well! I don't know him
at all. That's just the difference between me
and those others. They think they do, I know
I don't. Between us and the native there is a
great gulf fixed. I defy any man living to
bridge it. Yes, it is so. You may see them in
their hosts. You may have, as you suppose,
friends amongst them. You may study their
history, their language, their ways; but are
you any the nearer to understanding them?
Take one of the men whose characteristics you
have been studying. Look into his eyes!
Have you any distant idea about his thoughts?
Watch his ways! There is not an antic he performs&mdash;not
a word he lets slip unconsciously&mdash;that
will not be a mystery to you. I would
venture to lay a heavy bet that in a year that
man would give you so many surprises and
shocks that you would give up thinking you
knew the native mind.'</p>

<p>This is certainly not encouraging from a
man of so much experience; but I reserve myself.
I shall find out more presently. In the
meantime, and in the light of this conversation,
it was no little curious to hear what Chunder
Singh had to say on the relations between
England and India. Our conversation took
place this evening; in fact, as I have only just
come down from the hurricane-deck, which we
have pretty nearly to ourselves, every word of
it is fresh in my mind.</p>

<p>'The situation is a strange one,' said the
Indian meditatively. 'I doubt if the world has
ever seen a stranger. You have come to us&mdash;not
as a great nation that conquers another by
the resources of a higher civilisation&mdash;but as a
company of traders. Money-making&mdash;that was
your object. Yet you sent us of your best&mdash;great
soldiers, high politicians, men of lofty will
and noble aims. And we, Asiatics, who adore
in others the qualities we lack ourselves, have
paid them homage, and fought under their
banners in defence of the rights won from the
weakness of our rulers. And so, out of the
acts of a trading company, a great empire has
grown. But let me tell you,' said Chunder
Singh impressively, 'that the quality of the rule
smacks of its origin. It is just in most cases,
but it is not sympathetic, nor is its policy large
and beneficent. With any other nation under
the sun the results would be disastrous.
But you English are a strange people. You
go straight on. In your wildest flights you
cannot forget that you have a conscience, and
so you have won the respect of some and the
superstitious dread of others, and your empire
goes on increasing.'</p>

<p>'But you do not love us,' I said.</p>

<p>'How can we?' answered Chunder Singh.
'As in the Divine&mdash;which is the model of all
excellence&mdash;the Supreme Spirit, from whom all
flows, and to whom all must return&mdash;love must
begin from above. Do you love us? You
know you do not. I am not speaking of you
individually, or of any other man. One here
and there, considering the greatness of our land,
may take an interest in us. But, as a nation, do
you care for us?'</p>

<p>It was impossible for me to say that we did,
knowing full well the contrary, and then those
strange words, which echo still in my ears, were
spoken.</p>

<p>'Let England look to it! Let her listen to
the voices of her wise men! Let her know that
if she does not bestir herself now the time will
come when she must! She is standing to-day
on the thin crust of a volcano, which, at any
moment, may crack under her feet, sending her
down into a gulf of fire, which it will take all
her strength to quench.'</p>

<p>He would not explain what he meant, though
I pressed him earnestly. No doubt his words
were merely rhetoric&mdash;an idea of his own,
coloured with Oriental exaggeration; but they
haunt me in a very curious way. Can this, I
ask myself, have had anything to do with the
rajah's secret?</p>

<p>We are passing the coast of Portugal, a low,
barren-looking country. Rain clouds are floating
about; the sea is lumpy, and a veil of white
mist covers the land; but this is sometimes
lifted, and then the low, sandy coasts gleam out
with a startling brilliancy. I hear that, if this
wind holds, we shall put in at Gibraltar to-morrow.</p>

<p>&mdash;We did not put in yesterday. We were
kept out at sea by a gale of wind that came
rushing in from the Atlantic. What a day it
was! No rest for anyone. The waves swept
us from stem to stern, knocking us about till
our timbers creaked; and the wind howled dismally
in the rigging; and all day long there
were shocks of crashing pottery and racing
engines. It was a perfect Pandemonium. Being
new to this kind of work I thought it alarming
at first; and I shall never forget the chill that
swept over me when, early in the morning, I
looked out into the grey wilderness of leaping
waves. I was quickly reassured by my friends.
Colonel Trent laughed at the storm; the officers
looked, if anything, more cheerful than usual;
and the pale-faced ladies, who sat about in the
saloon, were as calm as if they had been in their
own drawing-rooms at home. I made acquaintance
with several this morning, notably one
Mrs. Lyster, whom I think I shall like.</p>

<p>In the night the wind abated, and when I
looked out this morning I found that we were
entering the Straits. The weather was delightful,
much warmer than it had been, the sun
flooding the sea with silver light, and a pleasant
breeze blowing. The ship is steady, too, which,
after yesterday's experiences, has been a great
comfort to us all.</p>

<p>&mdash;I meant to have written every day; but
since we left Gibraltar it has not been possible
to do anything that requires attention, and
writing has been out of the question. What
a Mediterranean it has been! Stormy days,
nights of black darkness and pelting rain; hurricanes
that seem to drive the ship before them;
and every day, and all day long, the wild symphony
of the tempest in our ears. I think,
however, looking back, that I have liked it. I
have had a curious, inexplicable feeling of relief.
I have not been obliged to do anything&mdash;even
to think. That sense of responsibility, which,
since my life fell into its new conditions, has
weighed upon me so cruelly, was for the moment
taken away. Sometimes, with an awe that
was not altogether painful, I would wonder how
it would be with me if I knew that the freedom
was not for a few moments, but altogether; if,
with one of those shocks of wave and wind, the
engines should break, and the helm cease to
work, and the ship settle down into the boiling
sea, and the officers come with white faces to
bid us prepare for death. After the first up-springing
of passionate regret&mdash;I suppose there
must be that while we are human&mdash;would there
be this sense of relief intensified? No more
beating about of the troubled spirit, seeking the
right way and finding it not; no more pricking,
heart-tearing activities; but in their place resignation,
a quiet acceptance of the decree of
the All-Merciful!</p>

<p>I was not so much engrossed in my own
sensations as to be oblivious of what was going
on around me; and I have, in the meantime,
made one or two friends. The chief of these is
Mrs. Lyster. She impressed me favourably at
first, and I like her better and better every day.
I find that she is Irish, which perhaps accounts
for the delightful vivacity and naturalness of
her manners. Though she has quite a host of
troubles, having just left a party of boys and
girls whom she adores, to join her husband in
India, she never gives way to depression; and,
in fact, it is only at odd moments that she
allows herself the indulgence of thinking of her
own affairs at all. The most of her time is
taken up in making things as comfortable as possible
for everyone else. I like her appearance,
too, her slender, upright figure, her well-bred
head and delicate face, with a sad look in the
dark eyes and a humorous expression about the
mouth, and her clever little hands that are always
busy about kindnesses. As she is travelling alone,
she has allowed me the pleasure of looking after
her a little. At Gibraltar, where we spent the
greater part of a day, I was her escort on shore.
In the course of that excursion I found out, to
my surprise and pleasure, that we have mutual
friends. She knows Lady Winter very well
indeed, and, having met my mother at Surbiton,
where it appears she spent two or three days
this summer, she may almost be said to know
me.</p>

<p>Since then she has given me a piece of news
which surprised and staggered me more than I
could have thought possible. Vivien Leigh, the
heroine of my river <i>fête</i>, is married to a Captain
Doncaster, in the 3rd Bengal Foot, a gentleman
whom she has known since she was a child, and
to whom she has been betrothed for the last
year at least. They were married the day
before our ship left the Docks, and will start for
India in the course of the autumn. I sincerely
hope that we may not come across one another.
I never wish to meet Vivien again.</p>

<p>&mdash;The weather is much better. We have
blue skies and sunshine, and a beautiful silken
sea. What a change it makes in the ship! The
decks, completely deserted a few days ago, are
gay with people, and the ladies have brought
out their pretty dresses and their dainty sewing
work, and two or three children are playing
about, and there is talk amongst the energetic
of music, and dancing, and charades. Mrs.
Lyster, of course, takes the lead. She is everybody's
friend; and, besides being the most persuasive
and genial of women, she is an old
traveller, who has studied the art of organising
talents. For my sake, I am sure&mdash;she will insist
that I think too much&mdash;she has made me her
lieutenant, and now all the time I can spare from
my Oriental studies, which are in full swing
again, is devoted to the task of persuading
people to make themselves amusing, and, when
I have succeeded so far, in bringing them up to
Mrs. Lyster to be 'organised.'</p>

<p>&mdash;Since I wrote last we have passed Malta.
We lay in the harbour of Valetta for a day
and two nights, having freight to land. I went
on shore, with Mrs. Lyster for my cicerone, as
she knows the little town well. It was an enchanting
day&mdash;the sky of the deepest blue, and
the sea like sapphire&mdash;and I enjoyed everything:
the little streets that seemed to slant
up into the radiant sky, their whiteness making
the blue more intense; the feel of the earth
under my feet; the cathedral of the knights
with its thrilling memories; the rush of quaintly-dressed
people in the cathedral square; our drive
into the barren-looking country outside the town;
our saunter through the curiosity shops. And
Mrs. Lyster was as charming and sympathetic a
companion as one could wish.</p>

<p>In the course of our ramble through the
shops we met several of our 'Patagonia' friends.
The result of all this buying will, no doubt, be
seen to-morrow, when, if this fine weather holds,
the little masquerade which Mrs. Lyster and I
have been planning is to come off on the quarter-deck.
The idea was started by Mrs. Lyster, and
we all think it excellent. A reception is to be
held by the handsomest girl on board in the
character of Britannia. Everyone presented
is to wear a disguise and to speak and act in
character with the impersonation. The first
officer, to whom the names are to be given
beforehand, will act as usher introducing the
guests. When they are all assembled the Captain
and one of the elder ladies are to pass them
in review, in order to award a prize to the most
striking and best-sustained personation.</p>

<h5><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h5>

<h4>THE MASQUERADE AND ITS CONSEQUENCES</h4>


<p>The masquerade, which came off this evening,
is over. I have taken part in it, and I am tired
and bewildered; but I know I shall not be able
to rest until I have tried to recall and to understand
what has happened. So I have asked for
a longer supply of light than usual, and I am
sitting alone in my cabin writing it all down.</p>

<p>As soon as the masquerade was arranged I
determined on my disguise. I would be an
Indian of high rank. I consulted Chunder
Singh, who with the most obliging readiness
entered into my project, undertaking to dress
and instruct me for the part. With this view
we retired to his cabin in the early part of the
day. He happened to have in his possession such
a dress as Indian rajahs wear upon state occasions,
decked out with jewellery which appeared
to be of great value. In these he dressed me.
Then he stained my face and hands a light
brown, deepened the colour of my hair and eyebrows,
and wound a magnificent turban round
my brows. This done he began to show me the
proper gestures to use and speeches to make, I
in the meantime watching him closely, and trying
to mould my behaviour on his. At first, so
far as I was concerned, it was a mere game;
but presently I felt as though an indescribable
and mysterious change were coming upon me.
I was not copying him only&mdash;his mind was being
reflected upon my mind. I was, in fact, stepping
out of my own individuality and into that of
another. I might have thought myself the
victim of a curious illusion had it not been that
there was an answering change in Chunder
Singh. For a few moments I saw him stand as
if paralysed, then a wonderful light overspread
his face, and with outstretched arms he came
towards me slowly, murmuring 'Brother!
Brother!'</p>

<p>To the end of my days I shall remember the
misery of that moment. I retreated before
Chunder Singh. I would copy his gestures no
longer. I took off the dress and sent him away.
As soon as it was done, however, I laughed at
myself for my folly. What did my uneasiness
mean? I was the successor of a rajah and the
inheritor of his wealth. If I could play the part
of a rajah, so much the better. When the
evening came I sent for Chunder Singh, and
said that if he would forgive my abruptness of
the morning I would put on his dress again. I
had told no one what I intended to be; not even
Mrs. Lyster. Why I made all this mystery I
can't exactly tell. It was partly, I think, to
humour Chunder Singh. I remember even pretending
that I should not appear at all, not being
able to rig up a suitable dress. Only the first
officer, to whom the names were bound to be
given in, was in possession of my secret.</p>

<p>I think, at the last moment, I should have
drawn back, if it had not been for Chunder
Singh. As it was, almost everyone was out
before I could make up my mind to be presented.
In the meantime the curious change of
the morning had come over me again, and I
felt not so much acting a part as living in it.
That others shared my illusion was evident from
the puzzled faces of the little motley crowd,
when I appeared among them, and was presented
in my turn to pretty Britannia, under a
high-sounding Indian title.</p>

<p>Gravely and reverently I made my salaam,
and then stood aside. Colonel Trent was close
by, looking well as an Arab sheikh. He looked
at me scrutinisingly, and addressed me in Urdu.
I had studied this dialect with Chunder Singh;
but I confess I was surprised by the readiness
with which I understood and answered the
Colonel. We exchanged a few more words, and
then he turned away from me, and I heard him
say to one of the officers in English: 'I thought
it was young Gregory; but I see I am wrong.
Who is it?'</p>

<p>The answer I did not catch.</p>

<p>And next I saw the light figure of my friend,
Mrs. Lyster, who was dressed as a gipsy, detaching
itself out of a group, whose fortunes she
had been telling. There was an expression of
mingled triumph and malice in her face, which
looked extraordinarily young, under its fantastic
head-dress. I saw that she expected to
find her friend, Tom Gregory, under the Indian
prince's magnificent mask, and that she was
jubilant over her own penetration in detecting
him. I think I wished her to find me; but I
could not help myself. For that hour I was the
Indian rajah. When Mrs. Lyster had received
my profound reverence, and gazed for a few
moments speechlessly into my impassive face,
the red colour flamed to her cheeks, and she
turned away. But the first officer, who knew
me, looked more bewildered than anyone else.
Two or three times during the evening I caught
him taking up convenient posts for observing
me; but he did not seem to be able to satisfy
himself. I happened to be near him when Mrs.
Lyster, who was really mortified by her failure
to detect me amongst the masqueraders, begged
him to give up his secret.</p>

<p>'I promise not to make any use of it,' she
said coaxingly.</p>

<p>'But I am bound, Mrs. Lyster,' he pleaded;
'and then, you know'&mdash;he was looking straight
into my face&mdash;'our friend, Mr. Tom, might be
nearer than we imagine. Think of his wrath if
he heard me betraying him!'</p>

<p>'Nonsense; look for yourself. There is no
one here,' said Mrs. Lyster.</p>

<p>'Except the rajah,' said the first officer, in a
melodramatic whisper.</p>

<p>She started and glanced at me. 'What
a turn you gave me!' she said pettishly. 'As
it happens I know all about him. He doesn't
understand a word of English.'</p>

<p>'Oh! doesn't he?' said the first officer,
trying to tip me a wink, but breaking down in
the process.</p>

<p>'Now don't you pretend to be so innocent,'
said Mrs. Lyster. 'I have it all from the Captain.
We took him on at Malta, and he has been
living in his cabin ever since, and Chunder
Singh persuaded him to come out in his warpaint
and mystify us all. You see!' nodding
her head triumphantly. And she added in a
lower voice, 'What a handsome fellow he is!
If it were possible really to like a native&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>But here, with a pang at my heart, I turned
away, for I did not wish to hear any more.</p>

<p>Shortly after this the deck-lights were extinguished,
and the little crowd of masqueraders
went down to the saloon, where, over a champagne
supper, the Captain was to announce his
award. And now came what, to me, was the
most curious part of it all. My name was called
as the winner of the prize; but I did not respond.
Thereupon there was a little explosion
of laughter and ironical cheering; and Chunder
Singh, who had been sitting beside me, pushed
me forward. With the curious sensation of one
awakened from a dream, I rose to my feet, said
something, I don't remember what, and received
the congratulations of my friends.</p>

<p>'You are a fine actor, my young friend,' said
an old fellow near me. 'I never saw a thing
carried off so well. You might have been
amongst the darkies all your life.'</p>

<p>'I protest, I am not sure of him yet,' said
another.</p>

<p>'Is he sure of himself?' This was from
Mrs. Lyster, who sat exactly opposite to me at
the table. I noticed, with a little pang, that
her tone was chilly, and she looked at me with
a gleam of something like anger in her eyes&mdash;I
am afraid she will not forgive me for having
disappointed her&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&mdash;My trick has produced consequences which
I was far from expecting when I planned it. All
of my 'Patagonia' friends, with the exception of
Chunder Singh, who is almost irritatingly affectionate,
have been giving me the cold shoulder.
The Captain and the first officer are excessively
busy whenever they catch sight of me. Colonel
Trent has chosen to adopt a short, reserved
manner which prevents me from addressing him
much. Mrs. Lyster is politely cold, and several
ladies, who had condescended to be gracious
to me, have quietly relegated me to a much
less intimate footing.</p>

<p>So far as these last are concerned I do not
mind; but Mrs. Lyster and I have been too
friendly for me to be able to give her up without
a struggle. I asked her this morning how soon
she meant to forgive me. She answered hurriedly,
but with a spice of resentment in her
manner, that she did not know what I meant;
there was nothing to forgive, and then, to avoid
more questions, she left me abruptly. In the
afternoon she approached me of her own accord,
and made an effort to be cordial; but the effort
was too apparent for me to be able to feel very
grateful.</p>

<p>What is the meaning of it all? Can she, can
any of them, imagine that I am only playing the
European? Mrs. Lyster cannot, for she knows
all about me. But even allowing that it were
so, not that I am an Asiatic, for that would be
impossible, but that my sympathies reach out
into the land where the ideas which have
measurelessly enriched the spiritual heritage of
the nations had their birth; nay, more, that some
secret tie of blood or mental kinship does actually
bind my life to that of the east&mdash;why
should they, therefore, despise me? Ah! what
a puzzle it is! What a strange, inexplicable
tangle! Who, who, will ever set it right?</p>

<p>&mdash;This has been a busy week, for it has included
our landing at Alexandria, our day up
the Nile, our night at Cairo, and our caravan
journey across the Desert to Suez, where we
took ship again. It is night now. I have just
come down from the hurricane-deck, where I
have been talking to Chunder Singh. We are
steaming quietly down the Gulf of Suez, with
the shores of Arabia and Egypt looking dim
and ghostly in the moonlight rising on either
side of us.</p>

<p>My mind is full of the strange thing Chunder
Singh has been telling me. I was right in my
original suspicion. He did, and does, take a
peculiar interest in me. It was for my sake that
he came over to England, and for my sake that
he is returning; but he would not seek to know
me until I had bade my home friends farewell,
and was launched, as it were, on my new life.
He was the intimate friend and counsellor of my
cousin, the rajah, who himself desired that he
should make my acquaintance in this way.
Other of his servants and retainers are to meet
me in Bombay, and put themselves at my disposition.</p>

<p>This is, of course, rather startling news. I
have scarcely realised it yet; but in the meantime
my feelings are mingled. On the one hand
I am thankful; I find it pleasant to know that I
have been thought of and provided for in the
great new land, which will presently open out
before me. On the other I have a sensation of
something like fear. It is as if the new life were
seizing me, drawing me in, as if I should never
again return to the old life, with all its sweet,
homely ways. No doubt this is merely a sentiment.
I ought to be thankful, and I am, that
there is someone to whom I can speak of the
future, and who, for the sake of those who have
gone before me, as well as for my own sake, will
advise and guide me.</p>

<p>One of the principal events of this week is
that I have made a new friend. My friend is a
little girl about seven years of age, though she
looks much younger. She has white skin, just
touched here and there with the daintiest rose-colour,
tiny bewitching features, yellow hair soft
as spun silk, and grey eyes that have a curiously
pathetic look in them. In figure she is
the lightest, airiest little creature; such perfect
hands and feet, and so ridiculously small. Light
as she is, I wonder sometimes that those feet can
bear the weight of her. She trots about the
deck in pink shoes that are like fairy's slippers&mdash;the
most absurdly beautiful things! One of
them fell off the other day, and she came to me
to have it put on, and I never had such a difficult
task in all my life.</p>

<p>It is only since the masquerade that Aglaia,
who is quite a little queen in her ways, has
deigned to take any notice of me. Before that
she would not respond to my advances at all;
now she is more friendly to me than to anyone
else.</p>

<p>Her languid, sickly mother, who I do believe
is taking the child out to India because
she lacks energy and resolution to leave her behind,
is only too glad of what she calls, no doubt,
the child's infatuation, so that Aglaia is my constant
companion. She is never in the way, dear
little soul! flashing in and out of my cabin, carrying
me off to the other end of the ship, where
there is much more amusement for her than on
the quarter-deck, sitting by gravely while Chunder
Singh and I have what she calls our lessons,
and falling asleep with her two dear little hands
in one of mine, and her yellow head nestling up
against my shoulder; she is always the same
gentle, delightful little being. 'I love you,' she
whispered to-night, just before her eyelids closed.
I had been called in 'to help her,' to use her
own expression, 'to go to sleep.' 'Don't go away
ever!' I wish I could keep you, my little
darling!</p>

<p>&mdash;It has been very hot lately, and some of us
have slept on deck. I did so last night for the
first time. Before I went to bed Chunder Singh
had been talking to me on the ancient philosophies
and religions of the East. The last subject
we discussed was the old doctrine of metempsychosis,
in which he is a profound believer. As
I fell asleep under the stars I seemed to be listening
to an argument respecting it. 'Why
should it not be?' said a voice.</p>

<p>'There is no evidence,' said another.</p>

<p>'Is there evidence for anything spiritual?'
said the first.</p>

<p>'For this there would be. Show me one
with memory of a past!' persisted the second.</p>

<p>A mocking laugh floated through the air.
Then the voice I had first heard spoke again.
'Come with me, sceptic,' it said, 'and I will
show you.'</p>

<p>In the next moment I found myself in Aglaia's
cabin. There lay my darling wide awake
in her berth, her yellow hair tossed back upon
her pillow, and her large grey eyes looking up
into mine sorrowfully.</p>

<p>'Are those the eyes of a child?' said the first
voice.</p>

<p>I turned and fled.</p>

<p>And next I was in a large church full of
gaily-dressed people. A newly-wedded pair were
moving slowly down the aisle to the music of a
triumphant march. Suddenly the bridegroom
vanished, and the bride stood alone. Wondering
what this might mean I looked into her face
and I knew it. The eyes, glittering with a fierce
light which held mine, were those of Vivien
Leigh.</p>

<p>It seemed to me then that the blood ran cold
through my veins as I heard the mocking voice
say:</p>

<p>'Are those the eyes of a woman?'</p>

<p>'A woman! A tigress!' I murmured.</p>

<p>The shock passed. I was on the ship again,
lying out upon the deck, and a face, beautiful
with tenderness, was stooping over me. 'Grace!'
I cried, but the shadowy form eluded me. Then
I heard a voice&mdash;<i>her</i> voice&mdash;'Not Grace,' it said,
'Aglaia.'</p>

<p>'No, no,' I cried out piteously.</p>

<p>'Hush!' whispered the dear voice. 'She is
lost, poor little creature! But be patient. I am
coming down to help her presently.'</p>

<p>Here the voice died away, and while I
was straining my ears to catch it I felt myself
touched.</p>

<p>It was a real sensation this time, for my little
friend Aglaia was at my elbow. She was in a
white robe daintily trimmed with lace that went
down to her tiny bare feet, and her pretty yellow
hair was all ruffled with the wind. 'Look!' she
said, pointing to the east. I obeyed her, and
oh! what a spectacle it was. For while we had
slept the rosy-fingered dawn, descending, had
opened the windows of heaven.</p>

<p>Lost in rapture I was gazing in, when my
little friend's small, plaintive voice recalled me
to the earth.</p>

<p>'Aglaia is cold,' it said. 'Carry her.'</p>

<p>I stooped, wrapped her from head to foot in
my plaidie, and took her up in my arms, whereupon
she laughed out joyfully.</p>

<p>'That's nice,' she said. 'I'm glad you're so
big. Let me look at heaven, and then I'll go
down to mammy.'</p>

<h4>DELHI: VIVIEN: A MALCONTENT</h4>


<p>The part of Tom's diary which deals with the
early days of his stay in India is too elaborate and
introspective to be largely used here. But the
service it has rendered to the writer of this story
in enabling him to trace its somewhat labyrinthine
mazes is incalculable. He has, however,
other sources of information. The servants whom
Chunder Singh gathered round the young heir
as soon as he arrived in Bombay&mdash;intelligent
men all of them, and trained to their work by
that notable man, Byrajee Pirtha Raj, the late
rajah of Gumilcund&mdash;have given him many useful
details. He has also been in communication
with the friends and acquaintances whom Tom
made on the road.</p>

<p>Chunder Singh, after making every arrangement
for his comfort, left him in Bombay and
proceeded at once to Gumilcund, Tom himself
having determined not to go thither until he
should have acquired a far greater familiarity
with the language, and some insight into the
manners and sentiments of the people. This
knowledge he hoped to gain by travelling.</p>

<p>The glorious winter of 1856-7 was just opening
when, accompanied by a retinue of servants
and a string of camels and carts which contained
everything necessary for a long camping-out
tour, he left Bombay. He had been a great
success amongst the little society of that picturesque
Eastern capital, and he took with him a
host of introductions to English people of the
civil and military orders on his route, any of
whom would have received him with pleasure;
but he seldom took advantage of his privileges,
mixing by choice with the people of the country.
Hoosanee&mdash;the bearer of the late rajah and his
own principal servant&mdash;was the medium of communication.
When the work of the day was
over&mdash;the long march, or the patient quest into
the secrets of antiquity&mdash;Brahmin priests and
Brahmin beggars, old soldiers, dispossessed landowners,
and native merchants both Hindu and
Mohammedan, would be introduced by him into
the tent where sat the English-bred youth in his
Oriental dress, ready and anxious to discuss the
questions that separate East and West. On these
occasions Tom would sometimes surprise himself.
He would sit down ignorant. He would listen
to what his visitors had to say and keep silence.
Then suddenly, and to himself most mysteriously,
a flash of inspiration would come, so that he
would speak to them&mdash;not as a young man and
a foreigner&mdash;but as one who knew the land, and
had authority amongst its peoples.</p>

<p>It was a critical moment in the history of
English dominion in India. Lord Dalhousie's
policy of annexation had added to the empire
vast provinces, the new rulers of which, impatient
to see the fruit of their labours, made, in
many cases with a stroke of the pen, such
changes as, in the natural order of things, it
would have taken years upon years to effect.</p>

<p>But society remained what it had been.
There was no relaxation of the tyranny of caste&mdash;no
attempt to educate those in whose hands
lie the influences that mould the lives of the
young. The people clung to their old customs
with all the more tenacity for the change in the
political order.</p>

<p>Meanwhile to the eye of the ruler, satisfied
with the good he had effected, the tranquillity
seemed to be absolute. The terror which in the
following year was to sweep through the land,
making the enlightened mad and the mild cruel,
had not begun to work. Yet, to those who had
the courage and wit to look below the surface,
signs of agitation were not wanting. Fiery
prophets rushed through the land predicting
the speedy end of the new dominion; there
were curious panics amongst the people and
soldiery&mdash;curious outrages, put down at once,
of course, and repented in dust and ashes;
while sullen-hearted men, whose claims to
dominion had been set aside, moved slowly
through the cities of the Punjaub and the
North-West Provinces, whispering to one and
another that the measure of the stranger's
tyranny was full, and that the times were ripe
for revolt.</p>

<p>One of these malcontents Tom Gregory met.</p>

<p>He had been spending two or three days in
and about Delhi, his camp being pitched under
the shadow of that glorious monument of Moslem
dominion&mdash;the Kootub Minar, which is several
miles distant from the city.</p>

<p>The season was midwinter, and the weather
had been enchanting. He spent his days in exploring
the tombs, temples, and palaces of the
city, and in the evening he rode back to camp
over the desolate plain that lies between old
and new Delhi.</p>

<p>One evening he was later than usual. The
glow of the evening had faded and the darkness
of a moonless night had fallen before he
reached his camp. Hoosanee came out to meet
him.</p>

<p>'Is all well, my lord?' he said, in a voice
that trembled with emotion.</p>

<p>'All is well,' said Tom, laughing, 'except
that I am a prey to hunger and thirst and
fatigue.'</p>

<p>Hoosanee raised a silver whistle to his lips,
and in a moment all the camp was in commotion.</p>

<p>Smiling to find himself the centre of so
much subservience, Tom went into his tent,
took off the European clothes he had been
wearing, bathed, put on an Oriental robe,
and, having dined in some haste, seated himself
at the door of his tent.</p>

<p>Presently there fell a deep silence upon the
camp. The syces were lying down beside their
tethered horses; the servants and camp-followers
were asleep; only Hoosanee, the ever-watchful,
sat behind his master, motionless as a bronze
image, but with eyes and ears on the alert.</p>

<p>It was not so dark as it had been. The
moon, an orange ball, was swimming into sight,
slowly and mysteriously, above the rim of the
silent plain, and the fields of space were strewn
with the white fire of an innumerable host of
stars. By their light Tom saw dimly above his
head the tapering shafts of the Tower of Victory,
and the glorious arched gateway close by.
On the other side, and but faintly discernible in
this light, was the famous mosque, once a Hindu
temple, beautiful with sculptured pillars, where
the Rajpoots and their followers worshipped
before the foot of the Moslem trod down their
holy places.</p>

<p>With a throbbing heart the English-bred
youth gazed round him. What was this that he
felt&mdash;an understanding, a sympathy, a reaching
out of his spirit as if these things were not new
to him, but old&mdash;nay, as if they were a very
part of his being? He tried to think it out, but
he was tired both in body and mind, and, try
as he would, he could not keep his thoughts in
order. He was entering, indeed, upon that
delicious drowsiness which is the prelude of
sleep earned by hard labour, when a furtive
movement aroused him. Alert in a moment,
he sprang up to see before him a tall, lean
figure, wrapped in a ragged robe.</p>

<p>'Who are you?' said Tom, 'and whence do
you come?'</p>

<p>'I came out of the darkness,' returned the
figure, 'and I go into the darkness again.'</p>

<p>'Come in and rest,' said Tom, lifting up the
curtain of his tent.</p>

<p>The stranger hesitated. 'You are the new
rajah of Gumilcund,' he said.</p>

<p>'I am the heir of the late rajah. Did you
know him?'</p>

<p>Here Hoosanee stepped forward. 'Excellency,'
he said, 'I know this man, and he was
known to the late rajah, my master. He is
a Brahmin youth, and the adopted son of a
prince.'</p>

<p>'Call Ganesh,' said Tom, 'to give him food
and drink.'</p>

<p>Ganesh, the chuprassie, or steward, a man of
the highest caste, was, as Tom knew, the only
person in camp from whom the Brahmin stranger
could accept food.</p>

<p>He turned to him and entreated him courteously
to enter.</p>

<p>'My brother will rest,' he said, using the
picturesque form of speech of the country, 'and
food and drink shall be brought to him.'</p>

<p>Without a word the stranger flung himself
down on a pile of cushions. He looked round
him boldly; but Tom noted with compassion
the wild hunger of his eyes. From under his
vestment he drew a cup and platter of silver,
richly wrought, which contrasted strangely with
his ragged robe. These Ganesh, the stately
Brahmin steward, filled, the one with new milk
and the other with rice and chupatties, whereupon
the stranger, having saluted his host,
turned away and ate and drank in a silence which
Tom preserved until the meal was ended.</p>

<p>'Is my brother satisfied?' he said then.</p>

<p>'For to-day,' said the stranger. 'But the
hunger will return.'</p>

<p>'Come again to-morrow.'</p>

<p>'And the following day?'</p>

<p>'Come the following day also.'</p>

<p>'How long will your tent be here?'</p>

<p>'Three days and nights.'</p>

<p>'And then?'</p>

<p>'I will go on to the higher country&mdash;to
Nepaul&mdash;perhaps to Cashmere&mdash;but first&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Go to the higher country at once,' interrupted
the stranger, 'or'&mdash;he looked at his host
fixedly&mdash;'become one of us.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean?' said Tom.</p>

<p>'I will answer by a question. You are an
Englishman?'</p>

<p>'I am.'</p>

<p>'But you do not love your people?'</p>

<p>The hollow voice had risen, and the question
sounded almost like a threat.</p>

<p>Tom was surprised, but he answered quietly,
'Of course I love my people. Why do you ask
me such questions?'</p>

<p>'I ask because I seek to know; because you
are a mystery. See! You dress as we dress.
You understand our language. You know our
ways. There is sympathy in your face. Twice
within this hour you have called me brother&mdash;me
whom the Feringhees have cast out. Why
is this?'</p>

<p>'I have a stake in your country,' said Tom
gravely. 'The Supreme Spirit, who is over us as
He is over you, has decreed that I shall take up
the work of a great and good man, who was of
you, and who has gone out from you. I do not
know all I wish to know of his ideas; but I am
convinced that he loved his people, and I am
learning to know them that I may love them
too. I call you brother because I am of your
kin. From the same great Spirit we came
forth.'</p>

<p>The stranger bowed his head. 'And unto
the same Spirit we return. My brother has
spoken truly. He has spoken as a sage.'</p>

<p>And thereupon, without answering Tom's
entreaties that he would stay or return, he rose
and took his leave.</p>

<p>The next day a strange thing happened.
Tom was busy in camp all the morning, having
letters to write and the accounts of his chuprassie
to examine and settle. Early in the afternoon
he rode into Delhi. He rode in by the Delhi
gate, and made straight for the Chandni Chowk,
the principal street of the town, where he intended
making one or two purchases. Here he
dismounted and gave his horse to the syce, who
led it behind him. The Chandni Chowk was, in
its way, a beautiful thoroughfare. It was very
wide, and a double avenue of trees, having a
canal of flowing water between them, ran along
its centre, while on either side of the street
were the stalls and booths where jewellery and
curiosity dealers exhibited their wares. It being
a Hindu holiday the town was crowded with
people dressed in all manners of colours. As
Tom walked along under the trees and basked
in the golden glory of the evening he enjoyed
keenly the life and movement about him. A
little body of fat Mohammedan merchants were
following him meanwhile with anxious looks,
and he was thinking that he must give himself
up as a prey to one of them when he heard
loud shouting. Looking round to find out what
it meant, he saw a smart English carriage drawn
by two spirited ponies coming at a tremendous
pace along the street. He had scarcely time to
see that the driver was a lady before he became
aware that a man, whose head and upper limbs
were wrapped in a thick chuddah, was right in
the way of the horses. In less than a moment
he had dashed forward, seized the man, and
drawn him back under the trees. In the next
moment the horses were pulled back, and he
heard a high, clear voice:</p>

<p>'So you are the knight-errant, Mr. Gregory?'</p>

<p>'Miss Leigh,' he cried. 'Vivien!'</p>

<p>'Excuse me,' said the lady, 'Mrs. Doncaster!'</p>

<p>'I beg your pardon; I had forgotten that
you were married.'</p>

<p>She laughed. 'Are you married too?'</p>

<p>'No,' said Tom shortly.</p>

<p>'What are you doing, then?'</p>

<p>'I am travelling.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Doncaster laughed, then turned her
pretty head round. 'By the by,' she said lightly,
'where is the unhappy person I nearly ran over?
I ought to give him something to soothe his
terrors.'</p>

<p>'Pray don't,' said Tom, who had recognised
in the scowling passenger his guest of the previous
evening. 'He is not a beggar.'</p>

<p>'Oh! isn't he? He looks very much like
one, then, and they love money, all of them, the
sordid wretches.'</p>

<p>'Here!' she threw out a rupee, 'take that!
It's all I can spare, and it will be wealth to
you.'</p>

<p>She spoke the last words in halting Hindustani.</p>

<p>The man whom she addressed&mdash;he had been
gazing at her fixedly for the last few moments&mdash;spurned
the coin with his foot, and it fell amongst
a group of misshapen, half-naked beggars, who
fell upon it fiercely, fighting one with the other
for its possession. The noise drew the people
together, upon which two or three of the native
police ran into the midst of the <i>mêlée</i>, shouting
and striking right and left. The whole city
seemed to be in commotion.</p>

<p>'You will be surrounded,' said Tom hurriedly.
'Whip up your ponies and drive through them!'</p>

<p>'Not at all,' said Vivien. 'This is a piece of
fun to me.'</p>

<p>As she spoke the man whose action had provoked
the disturbance drew himself up to his
full height, gathered his chuddah about him,
and having cast a glance of mingled hatred and
scorn on the fair Englishwoman, took himself
off.</p>

<p>Vivien looked after him, laughing. 'That's the
best specimen of a native I've seen yet,' she said.
'I wonder who he is. Doesn't he just hate me?'</p>

<p>'Is it wise, do you think, to make these
people hate you?' said Tom.</p>

<p>'Wise or not, it's amusing,' said Vivien.
'But Beauty and Prince are impatient, and
those two idiot syces of mine look half dead
with fear. Aren't they a handsome pair, by the
by? I mean the ponies, of course&mdash;not the
syces. Come and see me, Tom. I live in Cantonments.
Ask for Captain Doncaster of the
3rd Foot. Anyone will tell you where it is.
You are staying some time longer?'</p>

<p>'Three or four days.'</p>

<p>'Then be sure to come. I'll introduce you
to my husband, and show you my serpents.'</p>

<p>'Serpents!' echoed Tom.</p>

<p>'Yes; serpents. Funny pets, aren't they?
But they amuse me. I cow them, and then
pinch them, and watch them hiss and spit. I
have a cobra; he is grand when he's in a rage.
That man reminded me of him. Wouldn't he
just sting if he had the chance?'</p>

<p>'The crowd is thinning. Now is your
chance,' said Tom, standing away from the
carriage.</p>

<p>'Good-bye, then, till to-morrow, shall we
say?' said Vivien; and she drove off, leaving
Tom more disgusted than he had ever felt
before.</p>

<p>He was thinking it all over in the evening,
and wondering why he could not make up his
mind never to see Vivien again, when, suddenly,
the lean figure he had seen the previous night
rose before him. 'My brother has come back,
then?' said Tom kindly. 'I bid him welcome.'</p>

<p>The man did not answer, even by a sign.
He stood erect and rigid in the lighted space
before the tent.</p>

<p>'Come in and rest,' said Tom, 'and I will
call Ganesh, and he shall give you to eat and
drink.'</p>

<p>'Rest!' cried the Brahmin bitterly, 'rest is
for men, and I am no man. I am a dog, a
creeping thing, to be spurned by the foot of the
passer-by. If you have any pity, kill me!'</p>

<p>'My brother is raving,' said Tom pitifully.
'Fatigue and want are breaking his heart.
When he has rested and eaten he will be glad of
the good gift of life.'</p>

<p>'Does your Excellency speak like a sage
now?' said the Brahmin, with a sombre derision
in his voice. 'Does he know what he says when
he calls life good? I tell him that it is not good&mdash;it
is evil.'</p>

<p>'Life need not be evil unless we make it so.'</p>

<p>'We!' shrieked the Brahmin. 'We! I
see now that you know nothing. Look at me&mdash;this
ragged robe, these wasted limbs, these eyes
bright with the fever of famine, and say if I
have made myself what I am. I was brought
up as a prince. My father, who had no sons of
his body, adopted me, and I lived in his palace,
sharing his wealth and dominion, which were
one day to be mine. He died, and your people
denied my claim. I was not, they said, of my
father's kin, and I had no right to succeed him.
They would inherit for me and fulfil my duties.
The fools! Can <i>they</i> raise up children to the
departed to keep green his memory upon the
earth? Can <i>they</i> pay to his ashes the observance
that is due? The funeral feast, the oblation
of water and rice, the garment to clothe the
shivering spirit, and the gifts to priests and
teachers to redeem it&mdash;who will give them?
Will they? Can they? They know that they
cannot. While I wander homeless and ragged
upon earth, my father and my father's fathers
are in the pit, herding with demons and unfriended
spirits. Never can they be redeemed;
never, through all the crores of ages that are
to come, can they ascend into Swarga. By the
treachery of your people must the memory of
the pious die out. And when the Feringhees
become masters of us all, as they intend, there
will be no more offerings for the dead. Childless
our great ones will depart, and the pit will
be fed with the savour of their beauty, and Swarga
shall be a desert, and the gods will lament.'</p>

<p>He stopped, breathless, the veins standing
out like knotted cords from his temples, and
tears, that burned as they fell, chasing one
another down his cheeks. As for Tom, who
had been searching for something to say, he
stood silent. What comfort could there be for
trouble such as this?</p>

<p>But the man had a comfort of his own. All
at once his demeanour changed. His tears
stopped; his lips set themselves together; his
frame seemed to dilate, and the ragged garments
which he drew about him were like the
raiment of a king. 'Did I say for ever?' he
cried out. 'I was wrong. I see the imprisoned
spirits rise, and my flesh is stirred, and the hair
of my head rises up. The hour of release is
coming&mdash;it is near. On the dial of eternity it
is written. In blood and fire the dominion of the
stranger-race shall come to an end.'</p>

<p>'Hush! Hush!' cried Tom. 'You are
beside yourself.'</p>

<p>For an instant the man glared at him fiercely,
then his eyes fell. 'Take me in,' he said hoarsely,
'and give me food and drink.'</p>

<p>Ganesh was called, and his wants were supplied,
with reverent care; he, in the meanwhile,
accepting what was done for him with the
docility of a child. The meal over, he lay for
a long time with closed eyes on the pile of
cushions. At last, night having fully come, he
rose. 'Sahib,' he said to Tom, 'you saved my
life to-day, and I have not thanked you. At the
moment I was angry. I had said to myself, why
should I live? I will die. The proud-hearted
daughter of the Feringhees shall trample me
under foot, and my people will avenge me. But
I have thought better of it, and now I thank
you. The day may come when I may give you
more than thanks. In the meantime, take this.'
It was a piece of parchment, inscribed with
strange characters, and tied round with a crimson
thread. 'Do not seek to know what it
contains,' went on the Brahmin, 'but keep it
with you! If trouble or danger comes, and
you desire help, show it to one of our people,
and ask for him to whom it belongs. And now
farewell!'</p>

<p>In the next instant the stranger had gone,
and Tom was left alone with his amulet.</p>

<p>'The man is certainly mad,' he said to himself;
and it was in memory of a curious incident
rather than from any belief in the scrap of
parchment's virtue that he hung it round his
neck.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h5><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a></h5>

<h4>MEERUT AND THE ELTONS</h4>


<p>For reasons of his own, which he could not
have explained to anyone, Tom determined not to
see Mrs. Doncaster again; so marching orders
were given to Hoosanee and Ganesh that night,
and early on the following morning the train of
bullock-carts and camels that carried the tents
and baggage were on the move.</p>

<p>Tom followed them, taking one more ride
round the town before he went. The last place
he visited&mdash;this he remembered long afterwards&mdash;was
Hoomayun's tomb. He entered within
battlemented walls, mounted the massive platform
on which the palace of the dead stands,
and saw the marble tombs of the Emperor and his
friends, lying each in the frost-bound silence of its
vaulted hall. Then, from the elevated platform
he looked out on the soft green fields that surround
the city, and the river flowing peacefully
on its way, while the towering minarets of the
glorious Jumma Musjid, and the swelling
cupolas of the Pearl Mosque, and the red
battlemented walls of Shah Jehan's palace
loomed mysteriously through the amber-coloured
mist of the morning.</p>

<p>Silent and peaceful it lay, like a dream of
past greatness; the city, incalculable ages ago,
of proud Hindu warriors and earth-spurning
priests; the capital, in later years, and the
stronghold of Moslem dominion; the city swept
by wave after wave of revolution, sacked,
devastated, shifted hither and thither over the
plain; but never destroyed; to-day the city of
a shadow; to-morrow, what? As he gazed into
the tranquil plain, he felt his soul shuddering
within him. Grey antiquity seemed to be
throwing its arms about him and pressing out
his life. He panted for breath like one stifled.
What was he, and his people, with all their
greatness, what&mdash;what were they? Time, that,
like the fabled monster devouring its own children,
moves forward irresistibly, had brought
them into being, and Time, when their days ran
out, would thrust them from the path of the
living. Or was Time also an illusion&mdash;a shadow
thrown by shadows on the whiteness of eternity?
Did nothing really exist? Nothing&mdash;the awful
word echoed through his brain, like the knell of
a dying faith. He groaned and pressed his
hands together.</p>

<p>Hark! What was that?</p>

<p>'Is anyone there?' he said, looking round
him.</p>

<p>He saw no one; but a voice answered, 'I
am here.'</p>

<p>'Who are you?' said Tom.</p>

<p>'The same who spoke to you before. I
came to you with your inheritance. You ask if
there is a reality. I tell you that there is.'</p>

<p>'Then, in the name of Heaven, where is it
to be found?'</p>

<p>'Listen!' said the voice. 'You are like
many others who search afar off for the thing
that is close at hand. Look within; not without.
It is there that you will find reality, for
you carry it about with you. You, not your
body, but the self that animates the body, are
the reality of which you are in search. Know
this and you are free, but you cannot yet.'</p>

<p>'Why cannot I?'</p>

<p>'Because for the good of others you are
bound to action. But be of good cheer! Give
yourself to the influences that are carrying you
along. Resist the solicitations of sense, and, in
time to come, the knowledge that makes free
shall dawn upon you.' Whether it was a voice
outside of himself or a mere colloquy between
contending trains of thought he could not tell.
Little could he have imagined meanwhile that
here, where he had stood, dreaming of the past,
here, where the son of Baber and the father of
Akbar slept, the last of his race would hide as
fugitives, and that thence they would be taken
to imprisonment and death by a rough English
soldier, with a few troopers at his heels. Verily
Time devoureth its offspring!</p>

<p>Tom's next place of rest was Meerut, a large
military station about forty miles from Delhi.</p>

<p>It was afternoon when the cavalcade arrived.
The camp was pitched in a little mango-tope near
the native town, and in the evening&mdash;such an
evening as is common in North India in winter,
when the air is crisp and the sky cloudless&mdash;Tom,
who was in European dress, mounted an
Arab pony and rode into the station.</p>

<p>When he entered the Mall, which intersects
the cantonments, and is the pride of every
Englishman in the district, he found it full of
life. Buggies, drawn by fast-trotting ponies,
were flashing past; well turned-out English carriages,
full of ladies and children in gay summer
dress, were passing more slowly up and down,
officers in mufti riding beside them; and here
and there came an elephant, slowly pacing the
ground, his driver between his ears, and a
gorgeously dressed Indian gentleman in the
howdah on his back.</p>

<p>Tom was looking out on the gay scene when
suddenly he was pulled up; for a group of
smiling faces were coming to meet him along
the drive. For a moment he fancied himself in
England again. There was his dear Lady
Elton, as pretty and soft as ever, lying back
amongst the crimson cushions of a phæton, and
Maud was holding the reins, and Trixy and
Lucy were smiling at him from the back seat.</p>

<p>'Tom!' they cried in one breath, as he drew
rein.</p>

<p>'You here!' he exclaimed.</p>

<p>'I don't wonder you are surprised,' said
Lady Elton, whose face was pink with excitement.
'We left home much sooner than we
expected. The General wished for the girls'
sake to take another summer at home. But he
was wanted.'</p>

<p>'And as father wouldn't go out without
mother, and mother wouldn't go out without us,
we are all here,' said Trixy, putting her charming
little face forward.</p>

<p>'I am afraid that is about the truth of it,'
said Lady Elton. 'Where are you staying,
Tom?'</p>

<p>'In camp. I have been living under canvas
the last month, and a delightful life it is.'</p>

<p>'I should love it,' breathed Trixy.</p>

<p>'But you will come to us now, of course?'
said Lady Elton. 'Now, do. We are a household
of women. The General is out inspecting.'</p>

<p>'Tom likes women far better than men,' said
Trixy.</p>

<p>'Can't you be quiet, scatter-brain?' said
Maud, who had been waiting impatiently for
the opportunity of putting in a word. 'Mr.
Gregory' (turning her dark eyes upon Tom), 'I
hope you will come. It will seem like old
times.'</p>

<p>'When we sang and played together long,
long ago,' piped Trixy.</p>

<p>'One of you at least hasn't changed,' said
Tom, smiling at Lady Elton. 'Thank you a
thousand times. If you will show me where
your bungalow is and let me give directions
about my things, I shall be only too glad to
join you for a couple of days.'</p>

<p>'Good boy,' said Trixy, kissing the tips of
her fingers to him, and Lady Elton smiled
benignantly, telling him to come at his own
time&mdash;everything should be ready for him, and
Maud, who was even more dignified than she
had been at Surbiton, gave him a courteous
salutation and whipped up her ponies that Tom
might see how well she could manage them. As
for gentle little Lucy, who had been dumb
throughout, she was wishing that Grace had
been in her place.</p>

<p>And in fact that was the one drawback to
an otherwise charming fortnight. Grace was
away visiting. The pleasant, haphazard people
did not quite know where she was. She had left
them to visit an aunt at Lucknow, who was
feeling dull after an only daughter's marriage,
and had begged Lady Elton to spare Grace to
her for a few weeks. She might possibly have
gone on to Cawnpore, or perhaps to Agra, in
both of which places the Eltons had intimate
friends. They were expecting a letter daily. It
was the hope of this letter coming that caused
Tom to delay so long at Meerut. He certainly
enjoyed the little break. For those few pleasant
days he was able to fling off the burden of
Orientalism that had been oppressing him, and
to forget that there was such a thing as philosophy
in the world. He was his old self&mdash;the
Tom who had picnicked with the girls on the
Thames, bantering Trixy, laughing at Maud,
adoring Lady Elton, and losing his heart to
Grace. The General came into Meerut two days
after Tom's arrival. He had been inspecting
troops in the district, and was exceedingly jubilant
over the apple-pie order in which he had
found everything. In the evening, when, the
ladies having withdrawn, he and Tom sat
together over coffee and cigars in the large cool
verandah, he expressed his satisfaction freely.
'It is becoming the fashion,' he said, 'to run
down our native contingent. Nothing more
absurd! Properly trained and led, they are a
splendid force.'</p>

<p>'But supposing fanatics got amongst them?'
said Tom. 'There are a few of that sort about.
I have met them.'</p>

<p>'So have the rest of us, my dear boy. You
don't suppose I have served for thirty years in
India without meeting religious and political
maniacs? Why, the East is a hotbed for the
species. They flourish like a bay-tree by a river.
But look at the matter reasonably! Remember,
it is to the soldiers they must appeal. Now
what, in the name of Heaven, can the poor
devils offer that our men should run after them?
Money? They don't possess it. Plunder?
Well, to be sure, something might be picked up
at that little game, but the fellows have sense
enough to know that it couldn't last long. No,
no. They get more out of us than they could
out of anyone else. And don't tell me, sir,'
went on the General, working himself up to
what Trixy called his boiling-point, 'that there
is no sense of honour amongst them. For I
know there is. Yes, sir,' bringing down his fist
upon the table, 'I repeat it, there is! I am
speaking from experience, mind, not hearsay.
Why, I have had jemadars under me, who
have been proof against temptations that
would have corrupted half the Englishmen I
know.'</p>

<p>It struck Tom that the General was trying
as much to convince himself as to refute anyone
else; but he was careful to give no hint of
his suspicion, which, however, on the following
day was curiously confirmed.</p>

<p>It was early in the forenoon. They had returned
from their ride, and were sitting out in
the verandah, the ladies busy over fancy-work,
while Tom entertained them with a dramatic
account of his travels. He had come to his
experiences at Delhi, and the singular encounter
with Mrs. Doncaster in the Chandni Chowk,
when the General strode in, his face purple with
indignation.</p>

<p>'Read this!' he said, striking the news-sheet
in his one hand with the doubled-up fist of the
other; and as Tom, at a sign from Lady Elton,
who was not much affected by these outbursts,
took the sheet from him, he muttered down in
his throat, 'The fools! To make so much of a
trifle.'</p>

<p>The trifle was the well-known incident at
Dum-Dum, near Calcutta. A Lascar asked
drink of a Sepoy. The Sepoy, being of high
caste, refused haughtily to allow his drinking-vessel
to be defiled by the lips of a low-caste
man, whereupon the Lascar retorted that he
would soon lose his caste altogether, as the
Government were making cartridges greased
with the fat of cows and swine.</p>

<p>It appeared from the article which Tom read
aloud, that this story was flying through the
length and breadth of the land, and the writer
feared that, if something was not done promptly
to reassure the high-caste men in the army,
serious consequences would ensue.</p>

<p>The General heard it through, and then
burst into a torrent of wrath. A nothing!
Such a quarrel as might be seen going on any
day in the bazaars to be magnified in this way!
It was absurd. It was worse than absurd; it
was criminal! If there was a panic, men like
the writers of the article in question would be
responsible for it. For himself, he knew the
native army. They had their faults, but a finer
body of men never breathed. He was glad&mdash;he
was proud to say&mdash;that any day he would
trust his life and honour in their hands.</p>

<p>Having delivered himself thus, the General
calmed down, sent his bearer for a cooling
drink, swallowed it at a draught, and, looking
round on his wife and daughters, apologised for
his heat, and begged them not to be disturbed.</p>

<p>They were not thinking of such a thing.
Saucy little Trixy, whose eyes were twinkling
merrily, pointed out that he was the only disturbed
person present, except, perhaps, Tom,
who did look a little serious; but then Tom was
a 'Grif.' Tom protested with her; but she held
to her point. He might be a rajah's heir ten
times over, but he was a 'Grif' all the same.
Why, the way he treated natives showed it. In
the midst of which little discussion, Maud observed,
tossing her shapely head, and with a fine
expression of scorn on her face, that things
would have come to a pretty pass if <i>they</i> could
be afraid of <i>natives</i>. So far as she was concerned,
she would not mind meeting any number
of them with only her riding-whip in her hand.
'You know they are an inferior race; one can't
help feeling it,' she said. And Lady Elton said,
with her tranquil smile, that in Meerut, at least,
they did not need to be afraid, as they had
soldiers from England to protect them. So the
incident passed off, and in a few hours it was forgotten;
but Tom remembered it long afterwards.</p>

<p>The life at Meerut, meanwhile, was a very
pleasant one. There were not many girls at the
station, and the Eltons, being pretty, well-bred,
charmingly dressed, and full of life and go, were
considered a great acquisition by everybody.
They were made the excuse for all sorts of
gaieties. 'We mustn't let those girls be dull,'
the men would say, and the unmarried consulted
the married, and balls and picnics, riding-parties
and military sports were got up in their honour.
This was all in full swing when Tom arrived,
and he, as the Eltons' guest, was included in
their invitations, so that he had never been so
gay before. Feeling bound to return the hospitality
showered upon him, he took counsel with
Hoosanee and Ganesh, and one evening his camp
was decked out with flowers and bunting, and
coloured lamps were hung upon the trees, and
waxed cloths were laid out upon the ground in
front of the tent, and at night, when the large
full moon was rising, nearly all the European
population of Meerut flocked out to dance and
gossip, and sip champagne and coffee, and enjoy
a picnic supper in the quarters of the mysterious
Englishman, who was known already
through India as the 'Rajah's Heir.'</p>

<p>That night brought Tom's stay at Meerut to
a close. Hearing, on the following morning,
that Grace was at Lucknow, and that as she had
several more visits to pay there was not the
least chance of her returning home for some
considerable time, he could no longer be persuaded
to delay. Early in the forenoon his
camp was struck, and he followed it towards
sundown; Maud and Trixy, with two or three
young officers, riding out with him for some
little distance.</p>

<p>When he insisted at last upon their drawing
rein, Maud, who was riding in front with him,
looked into his face with steady eyes.</p>

<p>'Good-bye, Tom,' she said. 'What message
to Grace?'</p>

<p>'Will you take it if I send it?'</p>

<p>'Certainly,' holding out her hand.</p>

<p>'Thank you,' said Tom, grasping it warmly.
'Give her my dear love, Maud.'</p>

<p>'I will. Anything more?'</p>

<p>'Tell her,' hoarsely, 'that, whatever happens,
I shall not lose sight of her.'</p>

<p>'Isn't that&mdash;&mdash;?'</p>

<p>'A curious message,' broke in Tom, with a
smile. 'I am afraid it is; but I can't help it.
Good-bye.'</p>

<p>Then Trixy and her escort, a dashing young
cavalry officer, called Bertie Liston, rode up,
and the last farewells were spoken. The English
party returned to Meerut, and the Rajah's Heir,
followed as usual by his faithful servant, set his
face towards the desert.</p>

<h4>ON THE BORDERS OF NEPAUL: A JOURNEY THROUGH
THE JUNGLE</h4>


<p>The marching for the next fortnight was
delightful. Anything to equal the climate of
this Indian winter Tom had never seen. Morning
after morning there would be the same
brisk, invigorating air; day after day the same
dark blue heavens, unbroken by the lightest
cloud, would overarch, like a blessing from the
Almighty, the vast plains through which they
were travelling; and evening after evening the
same rose-lilac hue, wonderful beyond the power
of words to describe, would steal over the sky.
Hoosanee was their guide, and his ways afforded
some amusement and occasionally a little annoyance
to his master. While humble and reverent
in his manner, he kept the control in his own
hands. If Tom struck for independence hitches
occurred. The meals were half-cooked, the
beasts of burden were unmanageable, the coolies
had fever. And the artful Hoosanee had adroit
methods of making it appear that these annoyances
were due to the disturbed arrangement.
'As his Excellency desires, very right indeed!'
he would say when an order was given to him;
but Tom soon saw that if it was not Hoosanee's
desire also someone would suffer. So at last he
gave up the struggle. At Bareilly, which lay on
their route, Tom spent a few days, the Resident
being an intimate friend of General Elton's.
From him he heard that Lord Canning's policy
was disliked by Europeans, and that there were
rumours of disaffection in the magnificent army
of Bengal. That this, even if it were true,
would affect the security of India, of the North
and North-West, did not seem likely, yet some
were holding themselves on the alert. Leaving
Bareilly, they crossed the Goomtee, and were
soon on the borders of Nepaul proper, whence
several days' quick marching brought them near
the foot of the fine mountain range, within
which, as in a basin, lies the heart of the valley
kingdom. But the dangerous Terai&mdash;a region
of marsh and jungle, difficult to traverse at all
times, and in the rainy season deadly to travellers&mdash;had
yet to be crossed. The road through
this jungle was not so good as it has since
become. Here and there it was so deeply encumbered
with rank weeds and the stems of
giant creepers that the coolies had literally to
hack a way through for the carts, and this made
the travelling slow and difficult. They accomplished
it, however, without accident, encamped
one night above the belt of miasma, and the
next day, by dint of hard climbing, came to
Sisagarhi, a peak in the second and higher
of the two ranges that shut in the valley of
Nepaul.</p>

<p>It was near sunset when they reached the
camping ground. The day's march had been long
and fatiguing. The gradients were excessively
steep, and Tom had relieved his pony by walking
for long stretches. When he reached the wished-for
summit, he was so tired that he could scarcely
move. But in the glory of the scene that lay
before him his fatigue was speedily forgotten.
Far, far below, lying in the deepest shadow, was
the long fertile valley that forms the centre of the
mountain kingdom. From it, as from a basin,
rose the nearer mountains&mdash;range within range&mdash;green
slopes running up into wild, naked
crags, that flamed like beacons in the rose-red
of the evening, and beyond these, radiant and
awful, receding into unimaginable distance, the
gleaming snow-peaks of the Southern Himalayas.</p>

<p>Tom was, as he would have expressed it,
steeping his senses in the beauty of this marvellous
spectacle, when he caught sight of Hoosanee,
who was standing close by in a reverential
attitude, and looking at him wistfully. 'Is
anything wrong?' he asked.</p>

<p>'No, my lord,' answered Hoosanee.</p>

<p>'Then why do you look at me in that
way?'</p>

<p>'His Excellency's dinner is served.'</p>

<p>'Dinner, when that is before me! Look
out, man, and be ashamed of yourself!'</p>

<p>'If my lord will not eat, he will die,' said
the Indian servant humbly, 'and then what use
will these mountains do him?'</p>

<p>'Fine logic!' said Tom, laughing. 'And,
strange to say, convincing.'</p>

<p>Hoosanee led the way to the table, which
was at the door of his young master's tent. A
dinner that would have satisfied the requirements
of an alderman was spread out; but Tom
was too much excited to do it full justice. 'A
pity!' he said, as he pushed the untasted dishes
away. 'But it can't be helped. Don't look so
doleful, Hoosanee. I have taken enough, I
believe, to keep me from dying until to-morrow.'
Hoosanee bent his head, and was turning away.
Tom called him back. 'Come here,' he said,
leading him to a little distance from the camp,
'I have something to ask you.'</p>

<p>'It is time your Excellency should rest.'</p>

<p>'Leave that to my excellent self, Hoosanee,
and do as I tell you. Now, then, sit down!
This is a quiet corner, where none of them will
see or hear us. Don't crouch, man; sit! and
don't, for heaven's sake, look at me in that
pitiful way, as if you thought I was bent on
committing suicide to-morrow! I can assure
you I have a thousand reasons for wishing to
live a little longer. But tell me&mdash;why do you
take such an interest in me?'</p>

<p>'Am I not my lord's servant?' said Hoosanee
in a troubled voice.</p>

<p>'Of course you are; but that doesn't account
for it altogether. Can love and devotion like
yours spring up in a day?' The bantering tone
in which Tom had begun to catechise his servant
had gone. He was very much in earnest.</p>

<p>'The faithful servant is born, not made,' said
Hoosanee.</p>

<p>'That is no answer,' persisted Tom. 'Speak
to me plainly. Is it for my own sake or for the
sake of others that you are so anxious about my
safety?'</p>

<p>'It is for my lord's sake.'</p>

<p>'But how can it be?'</p>

<p>'Is it possible that my lord does not know?'</p>

<p>'I know nothing, my good friend. Enlighten
me!'</p>

<p>Swaying himself to and fro, and speaking in
a subdued whisper, Hoosanee said: 'When my
master, the rajah, was dying he sent for me.
Chunder Singh had been with him, and received
his last wishes. I was sad that no word had
been given to me, for not even his foster-brother
loved my master as I did. He looked up, and
saw that I was sad. He smiled, for he was ever
glad that we should love him. "Chunder
Singh," he said, "will tell my Hoosanee everything."
And with that, Excellency, he fell back
and died.'</p>

<p>There was a pause. The light of the evening
had faded, and the glory of colour had gone.
Pale and livid, like ashes of burnt-out fires, lay
against the horizon the palaces of snow and ice;
overhead, entangled in a wreath of vapour,
flitted a white ghostly moon, and the little stars
were twinkling out above the hills. Tom
shivered, and drew his cloak about him.</p>

<p>'And what did Chunder Singh tell you?' he
said, with a poor pretence of indifference.</p>

<p>'What he said, my lord, will sound strange
in the ears of one of your Excellency's people.
To them there is one life upon earth, and beyond
is the infinite, and the man who misses his
chance here is lost beyond the power of even
the Supreme Spirit to redeem. Is this not true?'</p>

<p>'It is, at least, what some of our religionists
teach,' said Tom. 'But how did you learn all
this, Hoosanee?'</p>

<p>'From my master, Byrajee Pirtha Raj, who
would often let his servant be present when he
spoke of these things with wise men from the
West. Sahib, our belief is not as theirs. We
do not so limit the power of the Supreme. It is
taught by our saints and sages that the life we
lead here is but one in many&mdash;that we come and
go, changing into new forms perpetually. While
we are low, so they tell us, we have no power over
these changes. Unconsciously we work out our
destiny, and expiate the offences of which we
have no memory. But to those who rise in
being it is given to rise also in knowledge.
These see behind them the path by which they
have come, and the road they must travel on
their way to the Supreme lies open in front of
them. To this stage my master, the rajah, had
come. Once more, it was revealed to him that
he should return to the earth.'</p>

<p>Here Hoosanee stopped, and looked at his
master in a strange, wistful way, like one pleading
for a boon.</p>

<p>'Well!' said Tom. 'Go on! How was
your master to return?'</p>

<p>'Does not my lord know? Has not his own
heart told him?'</p>

<p>'I know this&mdash;that if I listen to you much
longer I shall go mad. I was a fool to ask you
anything.' So saying, Tom started up and strode
off into the darkness.</p>

<p>He turned after a few moments, and saw
Hoosanee following him. 'Come here,' he said,
in a hoarse voice, 'and tell me who I am!'</p>

<p>'You are my master, Sahib.'</p>

<p>'Which master, Hoosanee? Him who has
gone?'</p>

<p>'I see no difference, my lord.'</p>

<p>'Then I am both. Is that what you say?'</p>

<p>'I say nothing. Will not my lord rest?'</p>

<p>'You have put a maggot in my brain,
Hoosanee, which will keep me from resting, I
expect,' said Tom, speaking now in English.</p>

<p>But he was wrong. Contrary to Hoosanee's
advice, his bed was laid out under the stars;
and when, after an interval that seemed like a
moment, he opened his eyes, to see a pale white
dawn, ghastly as the face of the dead, stealing
over the sky, and touching with cold fingers the
gleaming tabernacles of snow and ice in front of
him, he was conscious of having slept for many
hours, and of feeling extraordinarily strengthened
and refreshed.</p>

<p>So that day they went down to the foot of
the hills, travelling thence by a good carriage
road to Katmandu, the capital of Nepaul.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h5><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a></h5>

<h4>A VISIT TO JUNG BAHADOOR</h4>


<p>At Katmandu, the capital of Nepaul, Tom spent
several days pleasantly. He was delighted with
the city, the quaintness of whose architecture
and the gay costumes and kindly ways of whose
people gave him many new and agreeable sensations;
while the reception accorded to him, both
at the Residency and at the palace, which was
presided over by that great and enlightened
prime minister, Jung Bahadoor, left him nothing
to desire.</p>

<p>Ever since he left Bareilly he had been
thirsting for news; but news travelled slowly in
the days before the Mutiny, and no one in the
valleys had heard of the occurrence, which was
looked upon by the enlightened as the breaking
of the storm. On February 28, when Tom,
with a light heart, was setting out to visit
the English Resident at the Court of' the King
of Nepaul, the 19th Native Infantry, standing
trembling in their lines at Berhampore, were
listening with dull hearts to the harangue of
their irritated colonel, and refusing point-blank
to receive the percussion-caps handed out to
them.</p>

<p>From the wise and wily Jung Bahadoor
Tom learned much concerning the true state of
Indian affairs. He was relieved to find that in
spite of the faults of the British raj&mdash;faults
which this sagacious person was not slow to
criticise&mdash;he had a profound belief not only in
its general justice and beneficence, but that it
was the only power which could for the present
guarantee the land against anarchy. As such
he and his people would support it.</p>

<p>At other times he spoke of the late rajah of
Gumilcund, who had been one of his most
intimate friends, giving the young heir much
valuable information with regard to his character
and aims. One evening, which Tom
remembered long afterwards, on account of the
influence it was destined to have upon his life,
Jung Bahadoor invited him to a pavilion in the
palace where he often spent his evenings. To
the young heir their conversation was peculiarly
interesting, although he did very little of the
talking. Over his long hookah, which induced
a meditative vein, the great minister recalled
scene after scene out of the past&mdash;a past in
which the late rajah of Gumilcund's name often
figured. Tom heard of his cousin's wealth and
magnificence, of his fine personality, of the
adoration felt for him by his people. 'I believe,'
said Jung Bahadoor, 'that they refuse to believe
in his death.'</p>

<p>As he spoke he was looking at Tom absently.
All at once his expression became tense and
significant. 'What is the exact relationship
between you and the late rajah?' he said.</p>

<p>Before that question could be answered
Gambier Singh, captain of the king's bodyguard,
who was frequently the bearer of messages from
the court to the chief minister, and had the
privilege of entering unannounced, came out on
the pavilion. Seeing the minister engaged in
conversation, he was about to deliver his missive
and retire when, catching a full view of Tom's
face, he pulled up short.</p>

<p>'What ails my friend Gambier Singh?' said
Jung Bahadoor.</p>

<p>Recovering his presence of mind in a moment
the young Ghoorka captain turned to
Jung Bahadoor's guest, and saluted him reverently.</p>

<p>'The sahib must forgive the mistake of his
servant,' he said; 'but by my head it is a
wonderful likeness. I thought the dead had
come to life.'</p>

<p>'My guest is the heir of our friend the good
rajah of Gumilcund,' said Jung Bahadoor. 'I
was myself struck with the likeness, though,
strange to say'&mdash;turning to Tom&mdash;'I did not
observe it till this moment.'</p>

<p>'The rajah was my friend and father. I
salute his successor,' said Gambier Singh, making
another deep salaam as he withdrew.</p>

<p>But his curiosity and interest were too
strongly aroused to be thus easily satisfied.
Late that evening, when Tom was resting in his
tent, he introduced himself, making many apologies
for the intrusion. A long conversation, of
the deepest interest to them both, followed, and
when they parted, somewhere about the small
hours of the morning, they shook hands after
the kindly English fashion, and exchanged promises
of undying friendship.</p>

<p>Tom spent a week in and about Katmandu,
enjoying Gambier Singh's friendship and the
hospitality of the palace. Then he began to
think that he ought to be on the move. He
was actually making arrangements for a start,
writing letters and studying maps by the light
of a lantern which swung from the pole of his
tent, when one evening Gambier Singh, whose
invitation to an evening of revels he had just
declined, strode in. The flash in his eyes and
the abruptness of his movements showed that
he was labouring under strong excitement.
'Have you heard the news?' he said, before
Tom could speak.</p>

<p>'No; I have heard nothing. What has
happened?'</p>

<p>Gambier Singh answered with a question.
'I am told,' he said, 'that you are leaving
us?'</p>

<p>'Have I not told you so myself?' said Tom.
'I must go soon, or I shall be tempted to stay
with you for ever.'</p>

<p>The young Captain bowed himself and
pressed his palms together. 'Sahib, my friend
and brother,' he said, 'if you are happy with us,
as you say, let me beseech you to remain. We
are peaceful, and the Ghoorka soldier, if savage
to his foes, will be true to his salt. Over there,'
and he pointed across the mountains, 'there
will be wild work soon.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean? What has happened?'
cried Tom, springing to his feet.</p>

<p>'I mean, my brother, that the revolt has
begun.'</p>

<p>'Revolt! When? Where? Speak to me
plainly I entreat of you.'</p>

<p>He was pale to the very lips. In that instant
of time, while the dim mountain range which
a few days before he had crossed so joyfully,
frowned down upon him like a fortress, a hundred
torturing images pressed upon his brain.
The family-circle at Meerut, the General who
would trust his soldiers to the death, gentle
Lady Elton and the girls, Grace, wandering
Heaven only knew where, reckless Vivien flinging
her defiance at the crowd of Asiatics, his
friends of the voyage, Mrs. Lyster, tender little
Aglaia&mdash;what would become of them all if this
dreadful thing were true? Oh! for wings to
carry him over the mountains, that he might
see with his own eyes what was going on! In
the meantime, Gambier Singh's voice, which was
much calmer than it had been, came to him as
if from a great distance.</p>

<p>'Let my brother compose himself. It has
only begun. The North and North-West are at
peace.'</p>

<p>'Thank God!'</p>

<p>'But,' went on the young Captain, 'it is a
hollow peace. Of this my master is assured.
If your rulers are prompt, if they crush out
the insurrection with an iron hand, there may
still be peace, for the loyal will be strengthened,
and the discontented will fear to rise. If not,
the torch of rebellion will flame out fiercely.
From province to province it will be carried,
and the wild heart of the Asiatic, which discipline
has kept down but not subdued, will
take fire and leap out in rapine and murder.'
Then, in a few words, he told the story of the
mutiny of Berhampore. It was ominous, but not
nearly so dreadful as Tom had imagined. He
began to breathe more freely. 'Are you sure
there is nothing more?' he said. 'You are not
keeping anything from me?'</p>

<p>'No, by my master's head! But is it not
bad enough?'</p>

<p>'Yes, it is bad. Still it is a warning. The
evil cannot have gone very deeply yet. We
have time before us.'</p>

<p>'Who knows?' said Gambier Singh, shaking
his head; and he added, 'My brother will stay
with us till the storm blows over!'</p>

<p>Tom paused for a moment, then turned his
face, which was as white as death, to his companion.
'I cannot,' he said, 'a fire is consuming
me. What it is, or whence it comes, I
cannot tell, but I know that it will not let me
rest. See, do not hold me back! I must recross
the mountains. I must know what is happening.
I must see the terror with my own eyes.' His
voice sank, and then, in a moment, rose again,
shrill and penetrating, 'I must save my people,'
he cried, and fell back fainting into the arms of
his friend.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h5><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a></h5>

<h4>LUCKNOW AND SIR HENRY LAWRENCE</h4>


<p>It is early in the morning. The golden dawn is
breaking over the eastern hills, and the awful
snow-peaks of Himâla shine like the gates of
Heaven, when, in the pathetic dream of earth's
children, they rise before the eyes that have
looked upon the river of death. Here and there
some lower point, leaping up from the confused
mountain-world, has caught the glory of the
morning, and stands forth, a pale herald of the
full glad day; but the valleys, with all their
wealth of corn-fields, forests, and clustering
villages, are in the deepest shadow.</p>

<p>They are the valleys we have just left, for
we are on Sisagarhi again. A single tent is
pitched here, but coolies are already busy
loosening its cords, while the four small horses
tethered close by are sniffing the morning air
and neighing loudly. This, with the grunting
of the camels as they kneel to be laden, and the
harsh guttural cries of their drivers, breaks
discordantly on the stillness of the morning.</p>

<p>The two young men who have been occupying
the tent, and who are standing outside,
watching with full hearts the preparations for
departure, walk away together to a quieter spot.
For a few moments they stand silent, gazing out
upon the world of mountains. Then the taller
of the two holds out his hand, which the other
grasps.</p>

<p>'I have much to thank you for, Gambier
Singh,' he says, in the Oordoo dialect. 'You
have been a brother to me. I wonder when we
shall meet again.'</p>

<p>'I think we shall meet before long,' says the
young soldier, whose dark eyes gleam triumphantly
in the morning light. 'My masters
think that our help may be called for down
below there. If it is so, I shall be given a command.
We Ghoorkas will stand face to face
with the proud Brahmin warriors who despise
us and defeat them. Then my brother will seek
me out, and we will tell over again the dreams
we have dreamed in our valley.'</p>

<p>'They may not always be dreams,' says the
young Indian, and, after a pause, 'You are sure
my disguise is good?'</p>

<p>'It is no disguise. This is your true dress.
This is your true character. If my brother had
heard his own words when the fever was in his
blood he would hesitate no longer. But the
morning is advancing. Let us eat together
before we part.'</p>

<p>'You will eat with me!' says the other in
surprise.</p>

<p>'I am not a Brahmin,' answers the soldier.
'Have I not told you, besides, that you are one
of us?'</p>

<p>They retrace their steps in silence, and, while
the laden camels move off, partake together of
the rice and kecheri, and chupatties which
Hoosanee has been preparing for them, pledging
one another, after the English fashion, in a glass
of Persian sherbet. Then Gambier Singh rises.</p>

<p>'I would I could go with you,' he says, 'but
I know it cannot be. Before we part tell me
plainly what you will do.'</p>

<p>'Yes; I will tell you,' says Tom. 'I have
been thinking all night, and it is only this morning
that I have made up my mind. I intended
to spend this summer in travelling. I wished to
be more fully informed about the country before
I presented myself to the people in Gumilcund
as the successor of Byrajee Pirtha Raj. Then,
again, I thought I would go to Meerut, warn
my people there, and pass on the advice which
Jung Bahadoor has given to me. But it has
come to me that my words will be, in their ears,
as empty tales. Beside, there are many of our
soldiers there, so that they could surely hold
their own in any rising. It would be well also,
in case of the crisis you fear, that I should be in
Gumilcund and should have made the acquaintance
of her people beforehand. In this way, I
shall be better able to guide her safely, and it is
just possible that her loyalty may be of service
to the State. Therefore I have decided to go to
Gumilcund at once, trying by the way to pick
up what intelligence I can. Hoosanee, who
knows the road, will guide me. The people, I
believe, will accept me for the sake of him who
has gone from them. If it is so, I will stay in
their city watching the course of events.'</p>

<p>'Should it be as we fear,' said Gambier
Singh, 'what will you do?'</p>

<p>'I cannot tell yet. I must be guided by
circumstances.'</p>

<p>'Promise me not to expose yourself unnecessarily.'</p>

<p>'Unnecessarily? No!'</p>

<p>'But&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'My friend,' says Tom, holding out his hand,
with a winning smile; 'it is impossible for me
to say more. Before both of us the future is
invisible. God has willed it so. Farewell! I
dare not stay. Here or there we shall meet
again.'</p>

<p>'May the Gods grant it!' says Gambier
Singh.</p>

<p>And then he throws himself into his friend's
arms, embraces him with tears, mounts his
horse, and turns to ride down the hill.</p>

<p>Tom meanwhile, with many a backward look
at the retreating figure, goes off slowly in the
opposite direction.</p>

<p>And so the Rajah's Heir entered upon his
next important journey. I find, by referring to
his diary, which is my chief source of information,
that although wearisome and full of perils,
it was not without interest, and even enjoyment.
He was much calmer, for he had laid out his
plans for the near future, and the conflict between
the old life and the new, that had helped
to aggravate his illness, was over. Whether the
fantastic belief of his Eastern friends was true,
or whether having, as he now believed, blood of
the East in his veins, the life and doctrines of
the Indian sages did really, in some strange way,
appeal to him, he did not ask himself. The
result was the same. He was actually, for the
time, an Oriental amongst Orientals.</p>

<p>The season was advancing. When he left
the hill region and entered upon the plains he
found the heat almost insupportable; but the
deadly Terai was healthier than it had been a
month before, when it was still reeking with the
vaporous distilments left behind by the midwinter
rains, and they did not experience much
discomfort in crossing it.</p>

<p>The chief object of his journey being to find
out as much as possible of the state of the
country, he determined when they touched upon
the borders of Oude to turn aside from the
direct route and visit Lucknow, the capital of
the province.</p>

<p>Oude was at that moment in a critical condition,
and Lucknow was a perfect hotbed of
agitation. The lately installed Commissioner,
Sir Henry Lawrence, was indeed struggling
manfully with the task of reconcilement and
reorganisation, and if a crisis could have been
averted, his was the only hand that could have
done it. But it was not to be. He had come
into his duties too late. Fanatics, suffered to
flourish unchecked, had poisoned the minds of
the people. Misunderstandings that might have
been explained, little grievances that might
have been removed, had given weight to their
words and fuel to the smouldering fire of disloyalty,
and now not even Sir Henry Lawrence,
keen and far-seeing as he was, had any idea of
the depth and extent of the disaffection. As
for Tom, when he crossed the Goomtee, and saw
the beautiful city, with its splendid palaces and
mosques, lying spread out before him, still and
beautiful as a dream, in the evening's golden
glow, he could scarcely bring himself to believe
that its peace was dangerously threatened.</p>

<p>Mounted on one of the elephants which
Hoosanee had bought for him in Oude, and
clothed in the richest Oriental dress, he rode
through the city and its environs. Through
the English quarter he passed hastily. He had
been warned not to betray himself; but the
sight of his countrymen and countrywomen
taking their walks and drives was almost too
much for his resolution. He had an insane
longing to hasten back to his tent, throw off his
Oriental garb, and mix amongst them as an
English gentleman. In the native town he was
received, much to his surprise, with every demonstration
of respect. As, mounted on his
royal beast, with two syces, dressed in gay
clothes, running before him to clear the way, he
passed through the narrow crowded streets,
many left their work and bowed themselves
reverently to the ground.</p>

<p>Gradually the crowd increased. Strange
rumours flew from mouth to mouth. The
agitators had promised the people a leader&mdash;a
deliverer. Was this comely youth the leader
they were to look for? It was whispered that
he was; and, before he had reached the centre
of the town, it was choked, as far as he could
see, with swaying figures and eager, expectant
faces. Never in his life had Tom beheld such a
scene. It was a sea of humanity, in which he
felt himself swallowed up. In terror lest some
of the crowd should be trampled by the feet of
the monster he rode, he stood up and cried
out frantically to the driver to stop, and to the
syces to clear his way.</p>

<p>As he stood, raised high above their heads,
the confused cries of the multitude seemed to
gather themselves into one cry, which echoed
like thunder through the streets of the city.
'Speak to us!' From a thousand throats it
rang out simultaneously&mdash;passionate&mdash;imploring&mdash;a
herd of helpless creatures asking to be led.
'Speak to us! Speak to us!'</p>

<p>Then a single voice, winged with menace as
well as entreaty, rose above the others. 'Will
not my lord speak to us?' Again it rolled forth
like the growl of a wild beast whose prey is
escaping him, 'Speak! speak!'</p>

<p>Tom's uneasiness was increasing every
moment. What should he do? To speak might
have been to betray himself and to provoke a
disturbance that he would give his life to avert.
Yet every moment's delay made the danger of
an accident more imminent. Hoosanee, who
was riding close behind, came forward. 'For
shame,' he cried out to the people. 'Will you
presume to dictate to my lord? And what
think you, that he will break the vow which
does him honour, and tell his designs to such as
you? Wait patiently, each one in his place, and
you shall see what shall be!'</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause, for the people
of an Asiatic crowd are easily put down; but
all could not hear the words of the speaker,
who, after all, was only the prince's servant, and
presently the tumult began again.</p>

<p>Tom was in despair. He looked back to
Hoosanee. Should he try to quiet them with
quiet words; but what could he say&mdash;he who
was a stranger amongst them? Hoosanee's
agonised face gave him no help; but help came.
All in an instant, and mysteriously, the crowd
thinned away. It had flashed, like an electric
current, through the city, that one known to the
people&mdash;a prophet, who, under pretence of
stirring up a religious revival, had been detected
preaching sedition in the towns and cities of
Oude, and shut up, had escaped from his prison
and was now making his way in disguise to the
place where the city malcontents had been
accustomed to meet him. This was a vast
underground tank and gallery, which, being
approached through one of the most sacred of
the Hindoo temples, was safe from the prying
eyes of Europeans. Thither flocked the greater
number of the people who had been blocking
Tom's way; but many a backward look was
cast at the royal youth, as, his eyes fixed and
his brow sombre with thought, he was carried
slowly through the throng which remained.</p>

<p>'Your Excellency has found favour in their
sight. They would make him a leader,' said
Hoosanee, when, an hour later, they were resting
thankfully in camp.</p>

<p>'Why did my cousin die?' cried Tom,
bitterly, 'or why was I brought up in ignorance
of the people amongst whom my lot was to be
cast? If I had known a little more; if I had
been sure of myself, I might have spoken to
them, and they might have heard me, and the
destruction which is coming upon my people
might, perhaps, have been averted.'</p>

<p>'Let his Excellency have patience,' said
Hoosanee, soothingly. 'He is learning every
day.'</p>

<p>That night Tom wrote to his mother. He
had written in the same strain before, but never
so earnestly. 'I beseech you,' he wrote, 'not
for my sake alone, but for the sake of others, to
lift, if you can, the veil of secrecy which covers
our past. I am certain&mdash;how I dare not tell
you&mdash;that I belong to this people, and I believe
it is by birth; and, if so, I am passionately
anxious to know the nature of the tie. Pardon
me, dearest mother! I know how strongly you
feel on this subject, and, but for dire necessity,
I would not vex you by alluding to it. Say to
me, once for all, that there is no kinship, by
birth, between us and the East, and I will
trouble you no more. I will be content to
believe that there exists between me and this
people a mysterious spiritual affinity. If, on the
other hand, there is such a tie&mdash;if, through you
or through my father, I draw my origin as I
inherit my wealth from the East, it is time that
I should know it.'</p>

<p>The letter written, he thought he would go
out again and see the city by night. Wrapped
in a long white chuddah, and attended by
Hoosanee, he left his tent, which was pitched
near the Martinière palace, on the banks of the
Goomtee, and, after going through several narrow
lanes, entered a broad road lined with
palaces and gardens and English bungalows.
The gates leading up to one of the palaces lay
open, and its courtyard, with the windows and
balconies above, were streaming with light from
innumerable candles and oil lamps. Having
sent Hoosanee to inquire what was going on,
Tom heard that it was a <i>tomasha</i>, or entertainment,
given by the English to one another.
Hoosanee intimated further that there would
presently be a crowd of native men, and entreated
his young master not to run the risk
of detection by lingering amongst them. This,
however, was precisely what the wilful young
fellow meant to do; so Hoosanee, seeing that
resistance was useless, stood back, while his
master placed himself in the front rank of the
crowd that were gathering together to see the
show.</p>

<p>Presently carriages began to roll up. The
night being clear and beautiful, most of them
set down their loads at the gates. Tom could
in many cases not only see his compatriots, but
hear their voices. All of them seemed to be
gay and light of heart. The scraps of talk
which fell upon his ear were of the dance that
evening, and of a concert and amateur theatricals
that were coming off soon. Once he heard
a high shrill voice exclaim, 'Provision the
Residency? What nonsense! But Sir Henry can't
be in earnest;' and another, a man's voice,
answered, 'I can only say that I heard it. Preposterous,
of course. If we want a revolt, the
surest way to have it is to show that we distrust
the people.'</p>

<p>That pair swept past him&mdash;a young English
officer in uniform and a dashing, handsome
young woman. Then came a sensation in the
crowd. Many heads were bowed reverently,
and a mingled cry&mdash;of adoration from some,
and of contempt and defiance from others&mdash;broke
forth. The excitement was caused by
the arrival of the Chief Commissioner, Sir Henry
Lawrence, whose carriage, drawn by four handsome
little horses, preceded by outriders and
followed by a native guard, was coming slowly
along the street.</p>

<p>There was abundance of light from lanterns
swung on poles above the road and flaming
torches carried by footmen. Tom looked out
and saw a picture which he will never forget.
The chief&mdash;his lean, soldierly figure wasted with
anxiety for the people whom, as he fervently believed,
God Himself had committed to his charge;
his face, that face which to see was to love,
strong, yet curiously tender, deeply seared with
lines that told of such spiritual conflicts as
shake the soul to its depths; with mobile lips,
round which a smile, half humorous and half
melancholy, was hovering; and deep-set eyes
that looked out steadily from under massive
brows&mdash;was before him, and instinctively he
bowed his head; he knew that he was in the
presence of a hero. So far he had seen no one
else in the carriage, he had eyes only for the
chief; but as it swung round to enter the gates
of the courtyard he became suddenly aware of
another presence&mdash;'Grace Elton!' Wildly his
heart throbbed as, in the disguise which it
would have been the height of imprudence to
throw off, he saw close in front of him the
woman he loved. She was sitting back in the
carriage, her eyes, pensive as ever, fixed meditatively
on Sir Henry. She seemed to have been
speaking, for her lips were half parted, and it
appeared to him as if a shadow rested on the
face which, with its divine expression of seraphic
purity, was so infinitely dear to him.</p>

<p>A moment, and the vision was gone, and he
saw Hoosanee at his elbow, looking grave and
disconcerted. He told him that he was being
noticed, and implored him by all that was sacred
to come on.</p>

<p>'Have I a European dress with me?' said
Tom, as they moved away.</p>

<p>'Not one,' answered Hoosanee. 'My lord
will remember that the baggage-waggons were
left behind us.'</p>

<p>'But you might have kept out one. I would
give all I possess to be able to go into that ballroom
to-night.'</p>

<p>Hoosanee hesitated. 'My master might go
in native dress,' he said, 'if he would not betray
himself.'</p>

<p>'Would it be possible?'</p>

<p>'It would be easy, my lord. Other Indians
of rank have gone in. If my lord gives in his
name as the Rajah of Gumilcund, and presents a
largesse to the door-keeper, he will certainly be
admitted.'</p>

<p>The result was as Hoosanee had predicted.
When, an hour later, Tom was borne in a palanquin
to the gates of the palace, his embroidered
robe and gorgeous turban, with the magnificent
fee he presented to the door-keeper, gained him
immediate respect. No little to his embarrassment,
he was taken straight to the daïs on
which sat the Commissioner, surrounded by
English officers and grandees of Oude. After
the first shock, however, he played his part
correctly. Sir Henry, supposing him to be an
accredited guest, received him graciously, and
conversed with him for a few moments. Then,
feeling glad the ordeal was over, he stepped
down and set himself to watch the dancers.</p>

<p>With a face like a mask&mdash;for he had learned
the trick of Oriental passivity&mdash;Tom moved
about the hall. He was in search of Grace,
whom he saw presently dancing in a waltz with
an elderly civilian. After they had danced two
rounds her partner led her to a seat. Tom
passed them, making a low salute, and then
stood back, as near as he dared, with his face
averted lest Grace should recognise him. Her
light whisper penetrated to where he stood.</p>

<p>'Who is that Indian?' she asked.</p>

<p>'I really can't tell you,' answered her companion,
'which is a little curious, for I know all
the natives of distinction hereabouts. He was
certainly not at the last durbar. I must ask Sir
Henry about him.'</p>

<p>'I should like to know,' said Grace. 'He
has a fine face&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'For a native,' broke in her partner.</p>

<p>'For a native, if you will; and do you know,
it strikes me that I have seen it before.'</p>

<p>Here it occurred to Tom that he was doing a
mean thing, and he moved away.</p>

<p>The next time he saw Grace she was taking
her place in a quadrille, in the company of a
young and very handsome cavalry officer. Tom
did not feel quite so comfortable as he had done,
but he held his peace. While they waited for
the other couples to come her partner was protesting
with her earnestly.</p>

<p>'You will break all our hearts,' he said.</p>

<p>'Then somebody else must mend them,'
answered Grace.</p>

<p>'But, seriously, why are you going? Do
you think it will be safer at Meerut?'</p>

<p>'I am not going to Meerut.'</p>

<p>'Not? I thought your home was there.'</p>

<p>'So it is; but I have promised to pay a visit
to Nowgong.'</p>

<p>'Really! Such an out-of-the-way station.
Excuse me; but are you wise?'</p>

<p>'Wise or not,' said Grace, her every word
falling clearly on the ears of the tall Indian in
the background who did not think it wrong to
listen now, 'I am bound to go. My poor
little cousin&mdash;you will remember her, by the bye;
she married Captain Richardson&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes; I remember&mdash;a muff! I beg your
pardon, Miss Elton. I mean the gentleman, not
the lady. She was an angel. I hope nothing is
wrong with her.'</p>

<p>'I hope not, too; but we have been receiving
rather miserable letters lately, and
Uncle is going to see her, and I have promised to
go with him, and stay with poor little Lucy for a
week or two.'</p>

<p>The quadrille had at last been got together,
and Grace and her partner were called to attention;
but the Indian had heard enough. When
the dance was over he left the hall.</p>

<h4>A MODEL STATE</h4>


<p>Acting on the urgent recommendation of
Hoosanee, who saw reason to fear for his
master's safety, should he continue any longer
in this dangerous locality, Tom and his servants
left the neighbourhood of Lucknow early the
next morning. Two days' march of a perfectly
uneventful character brought them to the English
port and station of Futtehgur. There they
crossed the Ganges and travelled on quietly over
roads shaded with acacia, pipul, and cork trees,
into the wide and fertile plains of Central India.
Gumilcund was included within the bounds of
what was called the Central Indian Agency, a
district more or less under the Company's control.
Like several other small native states that
lay clustered together in this region, and that
formerly had lived a life of pillage and internecine
warfare, it had acknowledged the British
as the paramount power, and an English resident
had been accredited to its court. The government
of the little State had, however, been so
wise, just, and beneficent, that the position of
the Resident was a mere sinecure. During the
late reign his chief function had been to supply
the rajah, whom he, in common with the rest
of the world, admired and revered, with European
society.</p>

<p>There were few amongst the English who did
not enjoy a visit to Gumilcund. The courtesy
and urbanity of the rajah, in whose manners
the grace of the Asiatic and the simple dignity
of the well-bred Englishman seemed to meet,
with the novelty of the life to which he introduced
his own and the Resident's guests, made
the city popular. Some said that nowhere on
the face of the earth was there a place to compare
with it. Such statements, no doubt,
savoured of extravagance; but Gumilcund did
certainly possess certain advantages that are not
to be met with elsewhere. For fifty years&mdash;ever
since the son of Sir Anthony Bracebridge was
given the title and dignity of rajah&mdash;it may be
said to have been governed by one man, for
although in that period son had succeeded to
father, the ideas of the two, with regard to
government, were practically identical.</p>

<p>The first rajah was a man of experience. He
knew not only the barbarities of Indian social
life, but also the plague-spots of Western civilization.
He was, moreover, a strong man. When
he undertook to weld the chaos of the State that
had been given to him to govern into the ideal
that lived in his imagination, every one of his
measures, planned out beforehand with deliberateness,
was carried through unflinchingly. He
had wealth, which was one great factor in his
success. He had besides&mdash;and this quality his
son inherited&mdash;a power over men almost amounting
to fascination. Reforms which, if introduced
by any other ruler, would have certainly
induced rebellion, were accepted from him without
a murmur. When, after an unusually long
reign, he left the State to his son, it was already
well started on the path of progress.</p>

<p>The reign of the second rajah was no less
fortunate than that of the first, while his wealth,
which was drawn from other than Indian
sources, continued to increase.</p>

<p>His life, as we know, was cut short by an
assassin, a man from a neighbouring State, who
translated into this violent deed the jealousy felt
by many of the outlying peoples of the prosperity
attained by Gumilcund under those who
were spoken of far and near as her foreign
rulers.</p>

<p>To the immediate friends and followers of
the rajah his death was a terrible blow. They
honoured him as a master: they loved him as a
friend: they had been looking forward to the
wonderful things which he would do in the
future, and, in him, all their hopes were crushed;
but, so far as the State was concerned, his work
was done. Any one of the wise men he had
been training could have governed it now, for
every one within its borders was aware of the
exceptional advantages of their position. And
in fact, there existed at that time in Gumilcund
such a social order as was scarcely to be found
elsewhere. The State was prosperous, for all its
resources had been wisely developed, and this
prosperity was felt in every corner. There was
no seamy side in Gumilcund. The back slums
and dismal alleys that lie hidden in the centre
of our own great Western towns were not to be
found in its bright little capital. Idleness and beggary
did not thrive in its streets, and they had
long ago departed to find a home elsewhere.
There were no intoxicants, and therefore there
was little crime. Everyone who chose to work
could find work to do; so, although there were
inequalities of condition, there was no grinding
poverty. Oppressive acts of any kind being
promptly discovered and punished, the people
had become tired of practising them. The
women, too, were freer than in other parts of
India, for although here, as elsewhere, they
were shrouded in the graceful saree, they could
move about the city at their pleasure. Taking
it altogether, the State presented a curious example
of what can be done by one-man government,
when the people are pliable and the rulers
wise and enlightened.</p>

<p>Of course such results could never have
been reached had it not been for the tranquillity
which the power of the British name, and the
authority of her rulers, had given the district.
In former days the very prosperity and quietness
of the little State would have attracted
towards it the hostility of its neighbours, which,
indeed, the disastrous death of the late rajah
proved. He had never been slow to recognize
his obligation to the Paramount Power and to
impress it upon his people; and this, combined
it may be with the circumstance that the English
had never been their actual rulers, but often
their guests, was the cause of the love, amounting,
in many cases, to reverence, with which
English men and women were regarded in the
city and territory of Gumilcund.</p>

<p>The sympathy was mutual. Little Gumilcund
was tenderly regarded by the English.
Even Lord Dalhousie, the great annexer, when
the rajah wrote to him, that, being without heirs
he had adopted a son, who, with the permission
of the Governor-General, would succeed him,
could not find it in his heart to decree the
separation of Gumilcund from her native rulers.
Had he known that the heir was, to all intents
and purposes, an Englishman, the decision might
have been different; but the rajah, in his letter,
had given Tom the title which he would assume
were his heirship to the estate recognised,
stating that he was being trained and educated
in England, and it was allowed to remain an
open question. Under the English Resident the
rajah's heir should govern the State, and if his
rule proved as beneficent as that of his predecessors,
his title would be confirmed.&mdash;If, on
the other hand, he acted as so many young
rajahs had done when they came to the supreme
power, the rule would be taken from him and
vested in an English Governor. So the Governor-General
decreed, and then, having weightier
matters to dispose of, he dismissed Gumilcund
from his mind. Little could he have imagined
that, in days to come, it would prove a bulwark
of the dominion, which he had taken so much
pains to build up, and a refuge, sorely needed
for his distressed fellow-country people, in the
midst of a hostile rebellious continent.</p>

<p>Returning from this digression, which was
necessary if we would understand the position
of the little State, the government of which our
venturous young Englishman had come over to
assume, I must briefly follow his further movements.
He marched on quietly, for there was
nothing to indicate that the convulsion which
his friends had predicted was close at hand, and
though he wished to reach Gumilcund, he was
not in the least impatient.</p>

<p>Day after day, in this smiling tract of country,
the same prospect met him. There were fields
of green paddy and rustling sugar-cane, and
sheets of feathery dal, with which the large blue-green
leaves of the castor-oil plant contrasted
curiously; and, interspersed with these, were
tracts of marsh and jungle, and a few pleasant
groves of mango and neem. April had opened.
The heat was terrible in the day-time; but it
was a dry heat, and Tom stood it marvellously
well. For the most part they travelled
at night or very early in the morning.
During the forenoon, and in the awful noontide,
their camp would be pitched either under
a huge banyan tree by the wayside&mdash;whose dry,
thirsty roots were hanging down raggedly to
seek the soil, while its glorious over-canopy
of leafage made a shelter from the sweltering
sunlight&mdash;or in a grove on the outskirts of a
village or town. Sometimes he slept, but oftener
he thought and listened. How silent it was
in these noontide hours! Now and then he
would catch a rustle as a lizard or snake crept
through the dry grass, or there would be a
flutter overhead, where the little wild birds&mdash;parroquets
and mynas&mdash;sought a precarious
shelter, or a scream when some bird of prey
swooped down upon them. But for the most
part, even the vultures and the hawks, and the
hideous flying-foxes, that hung in uncouth bags
from the trees, were quiet. Man, meanwhile,
was at peace, having no energy even for labour.
Through the woods came no ring of hammer or
axe: the tramp of the wanderer had ceased
along the road, and long, swathed figures,
motionless as the sheeted dead, lay under the
trees and in the shadow of walls and houses.
The whole earth lay weltering in a fiery bath.
With the drawing on of evening there would be
movement. Flocks of parroquets would rush
out of the tree-tops screaming discordantly:
birds of prey would prune their wings and set
off slowly, with harsh cries, in search of food;
and the confused murmur of a restless humanity
would begin again.</p>

<p>Then the rajah's heir would emerge from
his shelter, and, while his tent was being taken
down, and his camels laden, would stroll into
the nearest village. There he would often take
his seat on the chiboutra, under a spreading
tree, where the talkers met together to discuss,
over their hookahs, such important matters as
the price of grain and cattle. They welcomed
him with the grave courtesy of Indians; but
whether they spoke freely in his presence he could
not tell. Except in one or two cases, when a
Hindoo priest or a Moulvie from a distance had
visited the district, he heard nothing which
could lead him to suppose that there was any
widespread spirit of disaffection, while English
magistrates were often spoken of in his presence
with a respect bordering on adoration. So he
went on towards Gumilcund with an easier
mind.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h5><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a></h5>

<h4>THE RANEE OF JHANSI</h4>


<p>Amongst the introductions which Tom took with
him to India was one to Dinkur Rao, Dewan or
Prime Minister at the Court of the Mahratta
Prince, Sindia, Maharaja of Gwalior. The
Dewan was one of those remarkable men who,
at critical times, stand out boldly from their
fellows. Subtle of mind and sagacious, and
possessing to a degree which, in a full Asiatic, is
unusual, the executive talent through which
great theories can be brought out in action, he
had already steered the State, to the government
of which he had been summoned when
the youthful Maharaja attained his majority,
through more than one dangerous crisis. Like
Jung Bahadoor, he had fully realised the importance
to his country of British over-lordship
in the peninsula; and, unlike the Nana, Kunwer
Singh, and the host of fanatic priests and
prophets, who thought that to exhaust England
and to drain her of her population would be an
easy task, he held firmly to his belief in the
strength, no less than the beneficence, of the
Paramount Power.</p>

<p>As regarded his policy, both internal and
external, Dinkur Rao might almost be said to
have been the pupil of the late Rajah of Gumilcund;
and although, being hampered by obstacles
from which that enlightened ruler was
free, such as an intriguing court, and a young
sovereign of unstable mind, who had on one
occasion at least deliberately reversed the wise
measures of the Dewan and shut him out from
his counsels, he could not give to his own people
such happiness and security as was enjoyed by
the people of Gumilcund, he was able, through
the superior position of Gwalior and her larger
resources, to exercise a more commanding influence
on the policy of the nations of Central
India than Gumilcund could have done, even if
her wise ruler had lived to tide her through
this dangerous crisis. The Dewan had heard of
the probable arrival at Gumilcund of the rajah's
heir. A certain amount of mystery surrounded
him; but he believed him to be, like his predecessors,
of mixed blood, and was not, indeed,
altogether indisposed to suspect that he was
actually the son of the late rajah by an English
mother. As he had loved the father, he was
ready and anxious to make the acquaintance
of the son. When, therefore, having passed
through the cantonments and pitched his camp
on an open space outside the native city and
fort of Gwalior, Tom sent in a messenger with
his letter of introduction and a note from himself
requesting permission to pay his respects to
the Maharaja and the Dewan, Dinkur Rao
started off, attended by a guard of honour, to
meet and welcome him. Then, having received
him with Eastern ceremony, he escorted him
back to the city, and introduced him to the
Maharaja, who set apart rooms in the palace
for his use.</p>

<p>Tom spent three days enjoying the hospitality
of Gwalior. Before the end of that time,
he and the Dewan had become firm friends. In
the long nights that they spent together on one of
the palace balconies, while the Dewan smoked
his hookah and looked up meditatively into the
starlit sky, Tom unburdened himself of some of
the thoughts and feelings that had possessed
him since he entered upon his new life.</p>

<p>He was troubled by his inability to lay out
the future. 'I make plans one day,' he said,
'and I change them the next, and I find no firm
standing-ground anywhere.' He was troubled
still more by the dual impulses that governed
him, and by the way in which startlingly new
thoughts and unbidden imaginations forced
themselves upon his mind. 'I thought I knew
myself,' he said sadly; 'but I find that my very
will is not my own.'</p>

<p>The Dewan consoled him. 'It is a time of
transition with you,' he said. 'The new has not
yet accommodated itself with the old. Western
ideas, and, if I may venture to say so, Western
prejudices, are warring in your mind with the
Orientalism which is its true element. You will
settle down in time and then you will take the
best out of both. Who knows that the Great
Spirit may not have decreed that you shall be
one of the reconcilers for whom the world is
waiting? Your father, the great Byrajee Pirtha
Raj, of blessed memory, believed that such would
be, and that only then, when the East learned
from the West and the West from the East, as
now they interchange terrestrial products, would
the earth and her long-troubled children enter
upon the holy path that leads to spiritual freedom.'</p>

<p>'And do you think this time is near?' said
Tom, trembling.</p>

<p>'Nay,' answered the Dewan, smiling. 'I
am no prophet. The future is with the gods.'</p>

<p>'But you think that England does well to
maintain her power in India?'</p>

<p>'I know that in England is our only hope.
They are preaching independence to the people,'
cried the Dewan, his excitement rising as he
spoke. 'Govern yourselves, they say. Be free
men! Throw the invaders from the West into
the sea! The fools! Do they know what they
mean? Are we then one nation in India? Can
we be governed by ourselves? They know very
well that we cannot. There is not one preacher
of sedition at this moment who is not well aware
that the retreat of the English would introduce
a period of anarchy such as even our unhappy
country has never known. And how could it
be otherwise? Moslems, Hindustanis, Bengalis,
Mahrattas, Sikhs, Punjaubis, Ghoorkas, hill
tribes of the north, and hill tribes of the south&mdash;we
are far more foreigners to one another than
French and English, Spaniards and Germans.
Which of all these, I ask you, shall govern the
others? Who are to be the free and independent
men, and who are to be the slaves?'</p>

<p>'The strongest would come to the front,'
said Tom.</p>

<p>'The strongest, yes; and think of the sea
of bloodshed and misery through which we
should have to wade before that was proved.
They know it very well, these preachers. I
caught one, a Moulvie of great sanctity, preaching
rebellion to my soldiers. Before I sent him
to Yama I asked him this question: who is to
govern us all, I said, when the English have
gone? I asked it in the presence of the poor
fools he had been trying to delude. If he could
answer me I said I would spare him. There
were three different religions amongst them, and
he knew that if he pronounced for one the
votaries of the other would tear him to pieces.
So he stood dumb and was led away to death.
No,' said the Dewan, 'however it may be in
the future, those amongst us who are wise know
that for the present the Paramount Power is
needed. We may regret the necessity; but we
should feel gratitude rather than aversion
towards the strong hand that, by compelling
our mutual animosities to be still, gives us time
for such internal development as can alone
make us great and prosperous. That at least is
our attitude, and my master will maintain it&mdash;of
this I am certain. Yes, even if his own
soldiers desert him.'</p>

<p>In after days, when Sindia and his State were
put to the test, Tom remembered those brave
words well.</p>

<p>He paid one more important visit before
going on to Gumilcund. It was to Jhansi, a
little state and town lying to the south of
Gwalior, which was one of the kingdoms, tributary
now to the English, formed out of the
ruins of the Peishwa's dominion after the
Mahratta War. The late rajah was the last
representative of the reigning family. His
widow survived him. She was beautiful, talented,
and strong. Her energy and ambition, held all
her life long in reserve, were ready to leap forth
when the moment for their exercise should come.
She would govern the state&mdash;she a woman, and
govern it as none of the voluptuaries who preceded
her had done!</p>

<p>Her dream was destined to disappointment.
The petition which she presented to the Paramount
Power praying for the succession, first to
herself and after her to her adopted son, was
rejected. But the Government of India would
not be unjust. A pension should be allotted to
the widow of the rajah, and she should be permitted
to reside in her own palace at Jhansi.</p>

<p>The Ranee gnashed her teeth. Had Jhansi
been strong and rich she would have flung the
Governor-General's pension in his face, and dared
him to do his worst. As it was she bided her
time. Yearning for vengeance with the fierce,
concentrated passion of the strong in mind and
helpless in body, she sat at home, brooding over
her wrongs, but doing nothing. Her guaranteed
income, so petty to her magnificence, was, in the
course of time, reduced. The late rajah had
left debts. The present governor refused to
settle them. The Ranee stated, mildly enough,
her inability to pay, and the governor of the
province decreed that her pension should be
mulcted of a certain yearly sum until the
amount due from the late rajah's estate had
been paid. And still the Ranee said nothing.
Being too weak to rebel, she was too proud to
murmur. But the sore in her spirit grew.
Sitting with bowed head in the retirement of her
palace, she heard of the worship in Hindoo
temples being stopped for lack of funds, of
priests and Brahmins wandering homeless
through the land, and of kine being slaughtered
in the very heart of the stainless city; but still
she made no sign. Then, at last, the year of
prophecy, with its strange portents, dawned.
Flat cakes, the sacrament of union in life and
in death, were carried from village to village.
From one to another, through the crowded
bazaars and markets, and into the temples defrauded
of their gains, there flew a mysterious
whisper of impending change. It penetrated to
the palace where the Ranee sat, nursing her
vengeance, and with a rapture, such as she had
never hoped to know, her darkened spirit leapt
to meet it. Destruction&mdash;death&mdash;torrents of
blood&mdash;a great dominion established on strength
and cemented by terror, passing away for ever.
What could it mean but that the hour for which
she had so long and so hopelessly craved had
come? And now the Ranee put on a smiling
face. She welcomed the English to her palace,
and entertained them royally. 'We must bow
to the will of the Supreme,' she said, when one
and another expressed surprise at her changed
attitude. She would even confer gravely with
the English authorities on the emergencies of
the time, and recommend measures for their
security. But all the time she was adding to
her bodyguard, and secretly drawing the discontented
about her, and exercising her magnetic
power of fascination on the troops.</p>

<p>Such was the state of Jhansi when the
rajah's heir came knocking at the Ranee's
door.</p>

<p>She had heard of his probable accession,
and of his progress through Central India, and
she was exceedingly anxious to see him; as soon,
therefore, as he gave in his name he was admitted.</p>

<p>It was evening, the Ranee's reception-hour.
This the captain of her lately enrolled bodyguard,
a man of splendid stature and dull, forbidding
face, told the visitor. Following him,
he wound his way through some narrow passages,
until a heavy curtain before a closed door
pulled them up. The captain threw the curtain
aside and opened the door, and a curious spectacle
presented itself to Tom. He was in a large
hall, paved and lined with marble, and lighted
by beautiful perforated windows, through which
streamed softly the golden light of evening. It
fell on a motley crowd, barefooted and dressed
in every variety of Eastern costume.</p>

<p>To Tom's eyes, dazzled by the sudden
change, there seemed to be nothing but a confusion
of swaying forms and faded colours.
Halting for a moment to recover himself, he saw
that the crowd which was spread thinly over
the hall concentrated at its upper end. Thither
his conductor led him, the throng parting right
and left to allow him free passage. In front of
him was a marble daïs, raised a few steps above
the level of the hall. To this he lifted his eyes
and found himself in the immediate presence of
a woman of queenly figure. It was the Ranee.
He thought, as he looked at her, that he had
never seen a finer sight. None, indeed, knew
better than the Ranee of Jhansi the effect of the
senses upon the imagination; no one has ever
been more skilful in use of the arts by which
such influence as she desired was won.</p>

<p>That evening she was dressed in a robe of
curiously figured satin and woven gold; a gauze
veil, which softened, but did not hide her proud
and beautiful face, was thrown over her, and
her seat was a finely carved and gilded chair.</p>

<p>For an instant the English youth was bewildered;
in the next he remembered the part
he had to play; while the Captain was recounting
his name and titles, he prostrated himself
reverently. When he lifted his head, he saw
that she was standing&mdash;a noble figure in her
splendid raiment&mdash;and making signs to him to
approach nearer to her. He mounted the daïs,
the lady encouraging him by a smile. An
attendant, in the meantime, brought forward a
low chair, upon which, in obedience to the
Ranee's invitation, he seated himself.</p>

<p>What was to come next? The experience
being totally novel, he thought his most prudent
course would be to wait. He sat silent, therefore,
feeling conscious in every nerve of the
keen and fervent gaze which, from under that
silvery veil, was enveloping him.</p>

<p>'Are you one of us, my lord?' said the
Ranee at length.</p>

<p>'I am the slave of her Excellency,' he
answered, bending low.</p>

<p>'I have many slaves in name,' returned the
Ranee, a proud and bitter smile playing about
her lips.</p>

<p>'Surely her Excellency is unjust to her
servants,' said Tom.</p>

<p>'You are right, Sir Stranger,' said one who
stood by&mdash;a ponderous and unwieldy figure of
a man, clad in white muslin tunic and crimson
sash.</p>

<p>'Is he, Nawab?' said the Ranee, a flash of
what looked like irony darting from her eyes.
'Then, let me beseech you, who have repeatedly
called yourself my slave, to dismiss our friends,
and to retire yourself. I would confer with this
youth alone.'</p>

<p>For an instant the Nawab's eyes gleamed
ominously, and his fingers played with the hilt
of his sword; but the Ranee's gaze was upon
him, and he recovered himself. 'Your Excellency's
orders shall be obeyed,' he said.</p>

<p>He went down into the hall to make her
wishes known, whereupon one after another
made their salaams; so that in a few moments
the hall was cleared. Our hero, as we shall
imagine, was feeling anything but easy. What
could the Ranee wish to discuss with him
secretly? Had she any dangerous designs to
communicate, and, if so, how could he&mdash;a man
in disguise&mdash;receive such confidences?</p>

<p>The Ranee was too keen not to read the
perturbation of his mind; but not keen enough,
fortunately for him, to trace it to its true
source. He was impressed, she believed, by her
beauty and dignity. This was no new thing to
a woman accustomed to homage; but the youth,
fair looks, and ingenuousness of her new acquaintance
made the incense of his adoration
peculiarly sweet. She was unscrupulous, as we
know; where she had wrongs to avenge she
could be cruel; yet she was not without the
generosity, which is the redeeming virtue of
strong characters. Looking at Tom she formed
a hasty resolution. He should not be drawn
into the plot they were framing. She would
prevent it. He had nothing to avenge. If he
threw himself into the quarrel it would be for
her sake; and, in the event of failure, he would
lose not his raj only, but his life; while the fearful
rapture of gratified hatred to which she
looked forward as the sweetener of her fall
would not exist for him. And so, to Tom's
surprise, for the Dewan had begged him to
listen with caution to anything the Ranee might
have to say, she gave him prudent counsels.</p>

<p>'You have come to us at an uneasy moment,'
she said. 'The hearts of the people are hot
within them, and none of us knows what may
happen. Had I been continued in the government
of my state, I could have led it safely
through this difficult time. But it was not to
be. The English are wise, and they have dispossessed
me.' Into her dark eyes there came
a gleam of anger, and her brows knit themselves
fiercely together; but in a moment she recovered
herself. 'What is all that to you?' she said.
'You are a stranger. Take the advice of one
who wishes you well, and wait and watch.
Your state is small. Nothing will be asked of
you by the English. Agitators will be afraid to
trouble you. Until you know what turn things
will take, you can keep quiet; and, if you lose
your raj, you will preserve your life.'</p>

<p>Tom was deeply touched by the care for a
stranger's safety which these words implied;
but they unloosened his tongue, so that he said
unthinkingly, 'You see danger of a rising?'</p>

<p>For fully a minute the Ranee looked at him.
She seemed to be searching him through and
through. Then her words dropped out slowly,
as if hissed through her teeth, 'There <i>will</i> be a
rising; I am certain of it.'</p>

<p>Everything&mdash;her beauty, her kindness, her
solitary position, a woman alone among all these
men, and the fearful nature of the crisis to which
she looked forward&mdash;seemed to rush together
to Tom's brain in one overwhelming tempest
cloud of thought. Wild with pity and terror,
he flung himself at her feet. 'Gracious lady,'
he cried, 'can you do nothing? Think, in
heaven's name! Do not be angry with me, I
beseech you! It is stronger than I am. I must
speak. I have seen your face; I have listened
to your voice with its words of good counsel,
and I know its power. Speak you to the madmen
who are stirring up strife. They will&mdash;they
must listen to you!'</p>

<p>'You magnify my ability, Sir Rajah,' said
the Ranee. 'I am only a poor pensioner of the
English.'</p>

<p>'You are a queen,' said the boy chokingly.
But he rose to his feet.</p>

<p>'I thank you for your good words,' said
the Ranee gently. 'They are pleasant to me,
and I shall not forget them. But say I did
speak, and say my people listened to me, what
then? Will the English give me back the power
of which they have robbed me? Will they atone
for the insults offered in their name to our families
and our faith? Will they give us men of
our own blood to be our rulers? I know they
will not, and I, who, if they had been true to me,
would have thrown the whole weight of my
influence into their cause, I wipe my hands of
them. If those who were once my people
revolt&mdash;they revolt&mdash;what is that to me? I
would not lift up my little finger to prevent them.'</p>

<p>'But,' said Tom chokingly, being moved
to the heart, 'you will at least&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I will listen to you no longer, lest you make
me angry. I have warned you, and that is
enough. And now tell me about England. I
have seen the name of the Island written on
one of our maps. It is a small place, but the
people must be restless and clever. I hear that
they have dominions in other parts of the world,
in America and the islands of the sea. How
do they defend themselves when their soldiers
are scattered?'</p>

<p>'Your Excellency,' said Tom, smiling, 'can
have no idea of the power and resources of
England. I have lived there since I was a child,
so I ought to know. She has cities of vast size
and overflowing with people. She has armies
to which those you see here are but a handful
ready at a moment's notice to be sent to the
ends of the earth at her pleasure. She has
great Generals&mdash;men of nerve and power and
endurance&mdash;in her service. She has cities of
workmen, who are forging every day the munitions
of war; and she has fleets in constant
readiness to transport her soldiers across the sea.
You in India, who have never been over the
black water, can have no idea of what England
is.'</p>

<p>'Jung Bahadoor told me something of this,
but I believed that he spoke largely for his own
purposes,' said the Ranee. 'He has always
cultivated the friendship of the English. You
assure me that it is true!'</p>

<p>'How could I dream such wonders? It is
true, every word of it,' said Tom, 'and I could
tell you more.'</p>

<p>'Nay,' said the Ranee with a smile, 'you
have told me enough. To know that they are
strong will not make me love them more. Tell
me of yourself. You are going on at once to
Gumilcund?'</p>

<p>'With your Excellency's permission, I will
start between night and morning.'</p>

<p>'Stay one more day, and look round you.'</p>

<p>'I thank your Excellency humbly.'</p>

<p>'That is well. Then I shall see you again
at this hour to-morrow.'</p>

<p>He rose and bowed low, and having called
some of the servants who were hanging about
the ante-rooms, she committed him to their care;
but Tom, acting on Hoosanee's advice, preferred
sleeping in camp to sharing the noisy hospitality
of the Palace.</p>

<p>Had Hoosanee had his will, they would have
started that night, but Tom felt bound to visit
the Ranee again. Never before had he met a
woman of her type. She fascinated his imagination,
so that he could scarcely sleep for thinking
of her, and it was after a vivid dream in
which the Ranee figured as a new Joan of Arc,
leading her troops to victory, that he opened
his eyes the next morning.</p>

<p>Hoosanee was standing over him with a cup
of coffee. 'If my lord wishes to see anything
of Jhansi, this is the time,' he said.</p>

<p>'All right, Hoosanee. Have Snow-queen
saddled,' said Tom.</p>

<p>Snow-queen was an Arab mare of the highest
lineage, which Tom had brought up with
him from Bombay. She was full of spirit, could
race like the wind, showed no signs of flagging
until she was completely dead-beat, and was as
gentle as a well-trained child in the hands of
those who used her kindly. No one but her
master and the syce, Subdul Khan, who had
been with her since she was a foal, ever touched
Snow-queen. To him, as to Tom, she was more
like a human being than a beast of burden.</p>

<p>A few minutes after Hoosanee had given the
order, Subdul Khan, who had already groomed
and fed the beautiful white mare, was leading
her gently up and down in front of their master's
tent. A second syce led a horse for Hoosanee.
Dressed in the half-Oriental, half-European
style, which is the out-of-doors costume
of many an Indian gentleman, Tom came out.
His face, which had been pale and sad that
morning, brightened when he saw his favourite,
and he gave a low whistle, to which she responded
by arching her neck, and pawing the
ground.</p>

<p>'The White Ranee is impatient,' he said
smilingly to Subdul Khan, as he gathered up the
reins and vaulted on to her back.</p>

<p>'She will go like the wind, your Excellency.
The day's rest has done her good,' said the
groom, looking, with pride in his dark face, at
his young master and the snow-white steed.</p>

<p>'Then let her go,' said Tom.</p>

<p>'One word, sahib,' said Subdul Khan, whose
hand was still on Snow-queen's bridle. He
spoke low and mysteriously, and Tom, fearing
that he had made some uncomfortable discovery
about his mare's soundness, stooped
down to listen. But all Subdul Khan said was,
'Let me entreat my master to be careful.
There are traitors in this place.' Before Tom
could ask him to explain, Snow-queen, free at
last, had set off, with her long, easy stride,
tossing her mane and snorting joyously. The
rapid movement was exhilarating. Tom's spirits
rose till he felt ready to defy the universe.</p>

<p>'What do we care for traitors?' he said to his
horse in English. 'We could escape, you and I
together, if we were put to it, old friend! I
can see you dashing through a crowd of them
like a whirlwind. There! gently! gently!'
Snow-queen, excited by her master's voice, and
in mere wantonness of heart, had tossed up her
heels and redoubled her pace. 'We are coming
into civilised quarters, Snow-queen, and we must
behave like civilised beings.'</p>

<p>They had crossed the Maidan, a wilderness
of burnt-up grass, where the native troops,
whose huts could be seen as a low, white line
in the distance, were drilled and trained under
their European officers. They were coming
now upon a road, on either side of which the
bungalows of the English military and civil
officers, with the humbler dwelling-places of
Eurasian and European clerks and mechanics,
were scattered.</p>

<p>Here Tom drew up and waited for Hoosanee,
who was some distance behind him. The
gallop over the Maidan had satisfied Snow-queen
for the moment, and she stood perfectly
still, while her master, stroking her glossy neck
caressingly, looked out before him.</p>

<p>It was very early indeed. The sun had not
yet leapt over the rim of the vast plain; but the
eastern heavens were glowing like a furnace,
and from the dreadful zenith star after star was
fading out. Beneath the sky the plain, with its
villages and groves and burnt-up fields, and
multitudes of freshly-kindled morning fires,
round which, like busy ants, the people clustered,
lay outstretched mysteriously. Not the
Elysian fields themselves could have been more
peaceful than this early morning scene.</p>

<p>Hoosanee came up, and they cantered quietly
along the pleasantly shaded road that led
through the European quarter. Early as it was
there were many stirring. Slender, pale-faced
English children, dressed in white blouses, were
mounted on ponies led by dignified Indian servants.
Several ladies were riding and driving,
and from the bungalow-gardens came sounds
of laughter and chattering, as little groups
gathered round spread tables under the trees to
enjoy the freshness of the morning.</p>

<p>Tom was looking out on this absently, his
heart full of the wistful longing, which always
possessed him when he saw English faces and
heard the English speech, to mix with his compatriots
as one of themselves, when a small face,
which had been for some moments looking up
into his face with questioning eagerness, detached
itself from the multitude of confused
impressions about him. He looked down and
saw as quaint and pretty a group as it would be
possible to imagine. The child, who had been
looking up at him&mdash;a little girl dressed like a
fairy in blue and silver&mdash;formed the centre of
the group. A ridiculously small pony, decked
out in gay trappings, and led by a smart little
Indian groom, carried the child, and an ayah,
swathed in spotless white, walked beside her.</p>

<p>'Why,' said Tom, pulling up, 'it is Aglaia!'</p>

<p>At the sound of his voice, the child, whose
little face had been looking troubled, clapped
her hands and laughed; and Tom, feeling quite
unable to preserve his character of Oriental
passivity, leapt to the ground, and caught her
in his arms.</p>

<p>The ayah, who had taken him for an Indian
of rank, looked at him in the utmost bewilderment;
but her attention was happily diverted,
for Hoosanee, too, had leapt from his horse and
he was looking at her with a curious fixity. No
sooner had she seen him fully than she broke
into a little cry of 'Hoosanee! How did you
come here?'</p>

<p>Tom looked back. 'Your Excellency,' said
the man, his dark face glowing, 'the young
woman is my sister Sumbaten!'</p>

<p>'Why,' said Tom, 'this is quite a romance.
And where do you and Sumbaten live, Aglaia?'
The child pointed with her small forefinger
to a small building on the outskirt of the
Maidan, which looked more like a tomb than a
house. She was clamorous that Tom should go
home with her at once. 'I've such lots of
things to show you,' she said. '<i>Three</i> new
dollies, and a tea-set, and a sweet little bird.
Then there's my dada&mdash;you haven't seen my
dada yet, have you?'</p>

<p>'No,' said Tom gravely. 'Is he nice?'</p>

<p>'He's lovely,' said the child. 'Come and
see him now!'</p>

<p>'I am afraid I can't, Aglaia.'</p>

<p>'Why can't you, Tom?'</p>

<p>'I am going on to another place, where I
have a beautiful house with all sorts of lovely
things in it. You and your mother and father
must come and stay with me there some day.'</p>

<p>'But you're quite close to <i>my</i> house,' persisted
Aglaia. '<i>Do</i> come!'</p>

<p>Here Hoosanee stepped forward. 'His
Excellency is being observed,' he said in a low
voice. 'He would do well to mount and ride on.'</p>

<p>Two of the Ranee's body-guard, dressed in
gaudy but ragged clothes, were strolling down
the road, their swords clanking behind them.
Hoosanee had been right in his surmise. Their
master, the Nawab, had pointed Tom out to them
the previous evening as a person to be suspected,
and they had come out with the object of spying
his movements. Had they heard him speak
to the English child in English, his fate would
have probably been sealed, for these men, who
had served in British armies, knew the sound of
an English voice. But Hoosanee's watchfulness
had, for the moment, forestalled theirs. When
they came up, Tom, who looked all the Oriental,
was mounted and giving directions in Hindustani
to Aglaia's servants. With reverent salaams the
men passed on, and Hoosanee whispered to his
sister that she should take the child away.</p>

<p>'Sahib, it is for their sakes,' he explained
hurriedly to his master. 'We should draw
suspicion upon them. The <i>budmashes</i> respect
nothing. They only wait for an opportunity to
do wickedness.'</p>

<p>Aglaia was resisting the efforts of her ayah
to draw her away. Her sweet violet eyes were
full of tears, she could not understand the
change in her friend Tom, or why he should
look at her so solemnly, when she was so glad
to see him. 'Won't you come?' she sobbed.
'I want you to see my dada.'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes,' said Tom low and hoarsely.
'Go home and I will come some day. Perhaps
when you want me the most.'</p>

<p>'I want you now,' said Aglaia.</p>

<p>'Missy come away; come quick!' urged the
poor little ayah whom Hoosanee's frantic signs
were goading into desperation. 'The sun it is
coming and mem sahib she scold poor Sumbaten.'</p>

<p>'Go on dear,' said Tom, lingering and feeling
half disposed to follow her, while Hoosanee was
writhing over his young master's folly and at his
own inability to make him do what was wise,
and then Snow-queen, the wisest of them all,
as Subdul Khan said later, settled the question
for them. She was impatient of standing, and
Tom touched her inadvertently, and all in a
moment she bounded away. She was seen
darting like a flash of light across the Maidan
and into the wilderness beyond. It was a
wonderful sight, so said the few Europeans who
witnessed it, marvelling at the daring and perfect
horsemanship of a native. Later it was said
that there was something uncanny in the
business, for the beautiful white horse and its
rider, though looked for diligently by one or
two, were not seen again in Jhansi.</p>

<p>When Aglaia had finished her usual prayer
that evening, she stopped. 'Mother,' she said,
'may I say something from myself?'</p>

<p>'Certainly you may, darling,' said Mrs.
White.</p>

<p>Then Aglaia shut her eyes up tightly and
clasped her hands. 'Oh! God!' she said.
'Thank you for sending Tom. Please may he
come back soon!'</p>

<p>After that she lay down contentedly. 'I
was going to cry,' she said. 'But I won't now.
He's sure to come, isn't he, mother?'</p>

<p>Before her mother could answer she was
asleep, and every night, up to a certain night
that I shall have to tell of presently, she insisted
upon adding this petition to her prayers.</p>

<h5><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a></h5>

<h4>THE RAJAH'S RECEPTION</h4>


<p>Hoosanee, who was by this time in daily communication
with Chunder Singh, was careful so
to time the arrival in Gumilcund of the rajah's
heir as to make it interesting and impressive.
Tom, indeed, who wished to test the truth of
the likeness to the late rajah, which so many of
his friends had observed in him, and at the same
time to put to the severest trial his own power
of maintaining the character of an Indian prince,
insisted that the people should not be prepared
for his arrival, and, Chunder Singh agreeing
with him, Hoosanee was obliged to give up his
dreams of garlanded houses, and throngs of expectant
people in holiday raiment. He indemnified
himself by arranging that they should
enter the city on the evening of a holiday, for
then all the workers would be out of doors, and
Gumilcund would look her best.</p>

<p>It was in the forenoon of a burning day that
the little cavalcade halted. They were now
within the boundaries of the Gumilcund State.
Tom, who was looking at everything with the
deepest interest, had already seen evidences of
a higher prosperity than he had met with elsewhere.
The splendidly kept roads were overshadowed
with fine trees; there were wells and
tanks in every direction; the villages, which
echoed to the sounds of industry, were neater
and more comfortable-looking than any he had
seen in India; and, throughout the day's
journey, he only saw one or two of the hideous
vermilion-painted shrines to Mahadeo, which,
elsewhere, were to be found at every corner.</p>

<p>They halted in a grove of fig trees, about
two miles distant from the city. Here Tom's
tent had been pitched, and, though far too much
excited to sleep, he threw himself down for a
few hours' rest.</p>

<p>'His Excellency will sleep in his own palace
to-night, if we continue to meet with the favour
of Heaven,' said Hoosanee, as he left his master
to his repose.</p>

<p>Hour followed hour. The sun blazed down
with the most terrible fierceness. Tom got up
and went to the edge of the wood, and returned
reeling and almost blind. He could do nothing,
he could not even think, and he felt as if the
day would never pass away. At last, towards
afternoon, Hoosanee came in with the pleasant
news that his meal and his bath were ready.
Tom knew what was expected of him, and he
was not surprised to see the finest of his Oriental
suits, with jewels that had often caused him
anxiety on the road, but that were now most
carelessly displayed, laid out for him to wear.</p>

<p>'We are in Gumilcund,' said Hoosanee, with
a proud smile, when his young master looked at
the display. 'There are no <i>budmashes</i> here.'</p>

<p>Not without some sense of amusement, and
curious consideration of what his friends at
home would say if they could see him, the
rajah's heir decked himself out. He wore a
crimson satin tunic, sown with pearls, and the
sash from which his sword hung was of golden
tissue, and his turban of fine muslin richly embroidered
shone with the fire of rubies and
diamonds.</p>

<p>It was an absurd magnificence, which, Tom
felt, would dwarf him, and, with an Englishman's
impatience of merely personal display, he
was about to fling aside these gaudy weeds and
ask for something plainer, when, glancing into
the mirror which Hoosanee held up to him
proudly, he was aware of such a change as he
had experienced on board the 'Patagonia,' on
the occasion of his first putting on an Oriental
robe. It came, this time, with a force that there
was no resisting. For an instant his brain
seemed to reel with the shock. Then, making a
strong effort to draw himself together, he looked
again, and tried to look calmly. For several
seconds he gazed fixedly into those strange eyes
that were gazing into his. Then he drew a deep
breath. It was true. This image before him
was not Thomas Gregory. There was a dignity
in the figure, a determination in the face, a
mingled fire and sadness in the dark eyes, such
as he had never seen in the English youth whom
he thought he knew.</p>

<p>What did it mean? Was he dreaming a
madman's dream, or was it, could it be, that the
awful thing which ever since he left home had
been haunting him was true? Could another
personality enter into and possess him? Would
he never in all the future be certain at any
moment of being himself? Questions such as
these were forcing their way through his mind,
when, all at once, the curtain at the door of the
tent was slowly lifted, and, looking round impatiently,
for he was in no mood to be intruded
upon, he saw his friend Chunder Singh standing,
with bowed head, before him. At the same
moment his perplexity and distress vanished,
and he knew that the curious conflict, so often
renewed, was over for the time. The English
youth had gone. It was the Indian prince and
chief who addressed his follower.</p>

<p>'Welcome to my tent, Chunder Singh,' he
said, heartily. 'What news do you bring?'</p>

<p>'I bring good news, my lord,' said Chunder
Singh. 'We are at peace, and all the State
is well-disposed to your Highness. It was your
will that we should not warn the people of
your approach; but the wind of rumour has
been busy amongst them, and I find that they
expect the return of their rajah. When my
lord enters he will be received with acclamations.'</p>

<p>'I will only go amongst them upon one condition,'
said the young rajah. 'You know that,
Chunder Singh.'</p>

<p>'I know it well; but let my lord have no
fear! We know by whose favour we live and
prosper, and in all Gumilcund I believe there
is no one who would be traitorous to the
Paramount Power.'</p>

<p>The eyes of the young rajah glistened as he
held out his hand, over which Chunder Singh,
whose eyes were wet with tears, bent reverently,
for he knew now that his old master had come
back to him.</p>

<p>After this they made their arrangements.
Hoosanee, who was called into their counsel,
was in favour of their all entering together; but
it was decided against him. The rajah should
ride in on his snow-white horse, with only Subdul
Khan, whose face was unknown to the people of
Gumilcund, behind him; and the rest of the
train should follow after about half an hour's
interval.</p>

<p>The sun had by this time gone down; a rose-red
glow of colour streaming over the plain
transfigured the burnt fields into gardens of
Paradise, and a thin white veil rising from a
multitude of evening fires covered the face of
the plain.</p>

<p>Feeling as if everything, and most of all
himself, were unreal, Tom mounted Snow-queen,
and, following the road pointed out to
him by Chunder Singh, rode on rapidly for two
miles. Then he drew rein, for he was within
sight of the city. Dreamlike and wonderful in
the evening light, the broad shield of the full
moon rising above its battlements, it lay before
him. It was all new; but he did not feel that
it was new. It seemed to him rather as if he
were coming to a spot where everything was
familiar. He pushed on again, riding more
slowly. A bridge thrown across a deep gully
lay in front of him. He crossed it at a foot-pace
and found himself under walls of red
sandstone, thick and high, in the midst of which
was a massive gate, flanked with towers, which
lay hospitably open.</p>

<p>By this time Subdul Khan, his only attendant,
was close behind him.</p>

<p>They rode in together, no one challenging
them, and again Tom drew up and looked
round him. He was in a dazzling little world
of pink and white&mdash;pink houses that stood back
from a wide white road, through the midst of
which ran a canal of fresh water overshadowed
with young trees, and white poles uplifting
lanterns above the heads of the people, who in
gay garments of pink and white were streaming
along the road, and towards the centre of the
city.</p>

<p>Keeping under the shadow of the trees so
as not to attract the attention of any one, the
rajah's heir followed the crowd. It was at once
the gayest and the most orderly crowd that he
had ever beheld. As he went on it grew thicker.
Beautiful white kine, with garlanded horns,
moved amongst them; flocks of white pigeons
hovered overhead, alighting wherever there was
a vacant space, and taking toll from the stores
of yellow grain that were spread out on sheets
at the doors of the houses; and the lowing of
the quiet beasts, and the whirr of the doves'
wings blended pleasantly with the buzz and
rumour of the city. Subdul Khan urged his
master to show himself; but he kept in shadow
still. He was interested and moved as he had
never been before. He felt more strongly than ever
the mysterious kinship between himself and these
people. He was tempted to prolong the dream-like
sensations of the moment, and to put off the
time when it would be necessary for him to act.</p>

<p>Moving on under the grateful shelter of the
trees, with the unconscious crowd about him, he
was aware of coming into a finer part of the
city. Large and lofty houses, which were very
much in the gingerbread style of architecture,
being decorated lavishly with balconies or
pavilions and pretty perforated stone lattices,
stood back from the road, and here and there,
as, going with the stream of the people, he
followed the broad main road, he caught
glimpses of quiet side streets and little open
squares, surrounded with lighted houses, all in
the same fantastic style. 'This is like a magnified
toy city,' he said to himself. And now he
had traversed the full length of the broad high
road that leads from the principal gate to the
market-place, and the avenue of trees which had
been sheltering him from observation came to
an end abruptly. Here for a few moments he
pulled up. To plunge into the sea of light and
movement that lay before him would be to
attract the attention of the crowd, and before
doing so he wished to understand what was
going on.</p>

<p>The market place, of wide extent and
planted here and there with groups of trees,
was the centre from which the principal streets
of the city radiated. It was here that all the
fun of the evening culminated. After a little
observation, Tom made out that the festival had
to do with Rama, hero of the great Indian epic.
His name was to be heard on every side. Processions
of women, decked with garlands of
flowers, were making the round of the market
place, chanting his praises; men in long white
robes, and elevated on small platforms above
the heads of the people, were reciting fragments
of the Ramayana; and in booths, closely surrounded
with eager crowds, pictures of the hero
and the companions of his exile were being
exhibited.</p>

<p>This much he saw himself. Subdul Khan,
in the meantime, who had alighted and tethered
his horse to a tree, was, by his orders, mixing
amongst the people. In a few moments he
returned, his dark face all aglow with excitement.
'Allah is favourable to my master!' he
exclaimed. 'He has come at a good moment.
It is the festival of Rama's return to his city
after his seven years of exile, twice told. There
could not be a better omen. Let my lord ride
down amongst them!'</p>

<p>Snow-queen had been standing like a marble
image under the trees. Her master shook the
bridle rein, and she moved forward. They had
been in shadow, and they were now in full light.
The effect was magical. In an instant the white
horse and its rider became the centre towards
which all that multitude of swaying figures converged.
They were silent for a few moments.
The suddenness of the apparition had struck
them with awe, and it was to some as if a spirit
had risen from the dead. But in the East the
crowd is more attuned to marvels than in the
West. The sense of awe was followed, in a
moment, by a rapture that was almost intoxicating.
Like an autumn wind that sweeps over
the yellow corn fields, bowing the ripe ears to
the ground, so the wild rumour ran, and
hundreds of heads were bent, while the cry of
'Rama! Rama!' rent the air. In less time than
it takes to tell, the trees in the market-place and
the balconies of the houses that bounded it, and
the platforms from which the reciters had been
declaiming, were thronged with eager faces.
Then from some one in the outskirts of the
crowd there came another cry&mdash;a cry that
thrilled Tom to the heart&mdash;'Rajah jee! Rajah
jee!'</p>

<p>Those behind pressed upon those in front.
Subdul Khan could with difficulty keep a little
space between the horse and the people, and had
not Snow-queen been as gentle as she was swift
there would have been imminent danger of
accident. But she stood quiet, or moved forward
slowly as she was directed, arching her beautiful
neck, and tossing her mane; and Tom, who, for a
moment, had been uneasy, looked round him
calmly and proudly. Then the acclamations
were redoubled. They echoed and re-echoed
through the square; they came rolling up the
streets that opened into it; they dropped down
like thunder from the roofs and pavilions of the
houses. 'Rajah jee! Rajah jee! Protector of
the poor! Cherisher of our city! Master of our
lives! He has come back to us from the grave,
and we are orphans no longer. Byrajee Pirtha
Raj, our prince and deliverer, is here!' These
and a hundred other cries rent the air, so that
the whole city was in an uproar.</p>

<p>Tom, meanwhile, was silent. He would have
spoken if he could, but the tumult was too great.
He moved forward slowly across the great square,
looking to the right hand and to the left. In
the centre of the square he came to a full stop,
the throng being so great that he could not go
further; and then, all of a sudden, there was a
lull, and a single voice, as of a herald, was heard
to exclaim, 'Vishnugupta has come hither from
his hermitage. Give place to the priest and
prophet!'</p>

<p>In the next instant the crowd divided reverently,
and, through this living lane, a tall
supernaturally lean figure, dressed in a long
white robe, its one arm, that was bare, holding
aloft a silver cage, through which shone the
glowing red of living brands, came slowly. It
stopped in front of the white horse and its rider.
The sudden apparition of the weird, white-bearded
figure, with the glowing brands, and
the smell of smoke in her nostrils, were almost
more than Snow-queen could bear. To the
consternation of Subdul Khan, she fell back
upon her haunches, snorting violently. But
Tom kept his seat firmly, soothing her with his
hand and voice, and in a few moments she was
quiet again.</p>

<p>Then the deep sepulchral voice of the priest
came towards him. 'I have come up from the
grave,' he said, 'to see you. Who are you, and
whence have you come?'</p>

<p>Firmly and proudly his answer leapt out.
'I have come from the Islands of the Sea, to be
the rajah of this city and state. They who
were the rulers of this people have sent me to
reign over them. Take me to the prince's house
and I will speak to them there!'</p>

<p>He was scarcely given time to finish, for the
acclamations, which broke forth more tumultuously
than ever, mingled now with sounds of
weeping, as if, for some, the shock of gladness
was too great to be borne.</p>

<p>'Our eyes have not deceived us. The voice
is the voice of our rajah. He said he would
come back to us, and he has kept his word.
Rajah jee! Rajah jee! Come in with rejoicing!'</p>

<p>Tears filled the young ruler's eyes, and his
heart throbbed passionately. Oh, if he could
only speak to these people as he would! For
in the pity and rapture of the moment all his
own hopes and wishes were melting away. He
was ready to give up everything, even his personality,
which seemed to be slowly receding
from him, for the sake of this people&mdash;this flock
without a leader&mdash;that surged round him.
Strange and solemn, as some of us dream the
entry into the new life&mdash;the life of the resurrection&mdash;may
be, were the moments that followed.
The voices of the crowd seemed to be drawing
him towards them, while, far away, like a half-forgotten
image in a vanished dream, he saw the
English youth with whom he had lived since his
infancy. Only an hour before he had fought
passionately to retain his hold on what he vainly
called himself. Now he was conscious of no
self. He belonged to this people, and to the
power that was working in him, transforming
all his impulses to its own creative will.</p>

<p>Slowly&mdash;the priest with the cage of living
coals in his hand making a way for him&mdash;he
passed through the lane of mute figures, and
silent expectant faces, in which the rapture of
his own heart was reflected, till he reached the
north side of the square. Right in front of him
towered a structure, larger and even more fantastic
and brilliant than any other he had seen
in the city. In colour it was a pale yellow,
which, under the many lights, looked like gold,
and the whole of the facade was covered with
balconies, pavilions, and pillared alcoves, that,
narrowing up from a broad base, had its apex
in a small open tower of glass and shining metal.
Within this tower was a lamp with powerful
reflectors, which cast a beautiful moon-like
radiance over the whole building, and into the
small enclosed court in front of it.</p>

<p>Before the arched gateway that opened into
this court Vishnugupta paused, and muttered a
few words of invocation; at the same moment
a tongue of white flame issued from the cage of
fire in his hand. 'It is a good omen,' he said
joyfully. 'Let my lord enter without fear!
The spirits of fire and air bid him welcome.
His rule will be as spotless as his heart is pure.'</p>

<h4>HOW THE NEWS FROM MEERUT WAS RECEIVED AT
GUMILCUND</h4>


<p>Of the days that followed the young rajah's
entry into his capital but little record remains.
He ceased almost altogether to write in his
diary; Chunder Singh, being always reticent with
regard to this period, there was no one about
him who could supply the deficiency; and, to the
deep distress of his English friends both at home
and in India, he gave up writing to them.
When, preceded by Vishnugupta, and followed
by Chunder Singh, Hoosanee, and the foremost
of the citizens of Gumilcund, he went into the
palace, he entered upon a seclusion which might
have been that of the grave.</p>

<p>But, though unheard of outside the state, he
was busy within it. I gather from hints scattered
through his later writings that, as day
followed day tranquilly, he entered more completely
into the life of the city; and that the
people&mdash;many of whom believed with Chunder
Singh and Hoosanee that in this comely stranger
their own rajah had returned to them&mdash;received
him as one of themselves.</p>

<p>It was not a happy time; no period of transition
can be altogether satisfactory to oneself.
Being highly strung by temperament, he felt the
mental strain more than others, while the complete
severance with the old life affected him
painfully. Up to this there had always been
something to connect him with the past. Jung
Bahadoor, Gambier Singh, Dinkur Rao, and the
Ranee of Jhansi had all spoken to him of England.
Wherever he had been he had seen
English faces and heard the English tongue;
here he met no one but Indians. Even the
Resident was absent. Owing to the death of the
late rajah, he had been on duty for some time;
his health, he said, was suffering; so, after
welcoming the new ruler, he had started with
his family to take holiday in a hill-station.</p>

<p>At first Tom felt disposed to congratulate
himself on this isolation. He remembered what
had been said to him on board the 'Patagonia'&mdash;that
between East and West a great gulf is
fixed. If, as he would sometimes imagine, he
was to lay the first stone of a bridge to unite
them, he must learn to stand firmly on both
sides. Then, too, he had little time for vain
regrets. He had begun to realise the magnitude
of the task that lay before him, and all the
energies of his nature were bent on preparing
himself for it. The language, the religion, the
laws, and social customs of his new country had
all to be made separate subjects of study before
he could presume to say that he understood its
people; while, in addition, there was the duty&mdash;peculiarly
sacred to him&mdash;of finding out what
the aims of his predecessors had been, and of
looking for and examining any records they had
left behind them.</p>

<p>But after those first few days, filled to the
brim with hard and unremitting toil, there came
a sense of want. His old feelings might be
stifled, but they were not dead. A dull craving,
which he could not formulate, haunted him
perpetually. During the night, which was his
only time of relaxation from mental labour,
there would come to him vivid visions of home,
from which he would awake with a sick anguish
that brought tears to his eyes and throbs of
pain to his heart. Like a nightmare the sense
of his isolation would weigh upon him; dear
faces from the past would gaze at him reproachfully,
and he would stretch out his arms to them
with a bitter cry. He could not&mdash;he could not
let them go.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, with the passion born of despair,
he clung to what remained to him of his past
life. He had brought away with him a little
English New Testament, his mother's last gift to
him. In the silence of his marble chamber,
when everyone in the palace was asleep but
himself, he opened and read it. How different
it was from the subtle philosophies into which
he was painfully working his way! Could it be
only that the words were familiar and therefore
dear to him? Or was there indeed some sweet
majestic power in them, such as is to be found
nowhere else in all the world? With a trembling
heart he read them over:&mdash;'He that loveth
his life shall lose it.' 'He that hath seen Me
hath seen the Father.' 'This is life eternal, that
they should know Thee, the only true God, and
Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent.' 'Come
unto Me, and I will give you rest.'</p>

<p>They were not new to him; from his childhood
up he had been instructed in them. They
were so familiar to his ears as almost to have
lost their sense to his heart. But now, coming
fresh to him from these other religions, they
smote upon his mind with a new power and
beauty.</p>

<p>From the utterances he turned to the record
of the life, and his wonder and enchantment
grew. Its purity&mdash;he had never thought of this
before, for he had not seen how men build up
their deities&mdash;its selfless love, its courage, its
devotion; these came upon him like a revelation.
More than once in these silent nights he
asked himself if this might not be the secret,
this the reconciling element which, after these
many ages of ignorance and disunion, would
blend the two continents together so that they
might move forward to a new era of blessedness.
But as yet he said nothing, even to Chunder
Singh.</p>

<p>The sultry month of April ran its course;
the heat continued to be terrible; but the young
rajah, in his large marble-lined rooms, artificially
darkened and cooled with flowing water
and the spray of fountains, suffered little inconvenience
from it.</p>

<p>He heard daily of the outside world, and
what he heard was reassuring. In these latter
days of April it seemed to the English in the
North-west Provinces&mdash;who were for the most
part as ignorant of the inner life of the people
about them as the infant is of the feelings of
those who dandle it in their arms&mdash;that any
danger which might once have existed was over.
The soldiers had been convinced by a variety
of telling examples that to fight against their
salt would be the height of folly; and the
people, even if they were disaffected, as a few
acts of incendiarism, with a sullen demeanour
towards the English, seemed to indicate, could
do nothing without the army.</p>

<p>May opened, and still they held on their
way quietly, and the rajah's heir began to hope
that the fanatics were silenced by hard and
stubborn facts, and that the bitterness, so long
foretold, had run its course. Then, like a flash
of lightning flaming across the blue of a cloudless
sky, came the news of the revolt at Meerut.</p>

<p>There are many still living who will remember
the horror and sickening dismay which
flew from station to station as the story, discredited
at first, pressed itself home to the
minds of the conquering race. We had heard
unpleasant rumours before, here and there a
mutinous regiment, bungalows set on fire,
outrages committed, muttered insults in the
public highways; some of us, indeed, had been
visited with vague apprehensions. But there
was always some one of experience at hand to
point out how foolish it was to be afraid either
of the people or the soldiers, and we were only
too glad to be reassured. So much the greater
was the shock of this terrible intelligence. It
is true that it was nothing like so dreadful as
what we were to hear later. The mutineers
were young in crime and fearful of punishment.
As a fact, it was rather a herd of frightened
wild creatures that rushed madly out of
the burning station on that awful Sunday
night than a victorious army triumphing in its
first success. But this we did not know. All
we saw and understood was the extraordinary
audacity of this first definite move. Through
the breathless days that followed we were
momentarily expecting to hear of the mutineers
being pursued and punished. Our servants
looked at us strangely. Native officers and
soldiers, who, in the first flush of surprise, had
passionately sworn to be faithful, began to lift
up their heads. Old English commanders, of
the type of General Elton, who was away from
home on a tour of inspection in the outlying
districts, gnashed their teeth with impotent fury,
and wondered what the people at Meerut were
about. For the news we expected never came.
The next distinct intelligence was that flashed
from the telegraph station at Delhi by the young
signaller, who, with the messengers of death
yelling in his ears, was working his instrument
quietly: 'The Sepoys have come in from
Meerut, and are burning everything; we must
shut up.'</p>

<p>Not till then did the full magnitude of the
disaster that had come to us break upon our
minds. Ah! what a change it was! Few of us
can have any conception of its horror. From
a life that is quiet, simple, and secure, to be
plunged all in a moment into the dark, strenuous
world of tragedy, nerves strung up, senses on
the alert, affection made lurid by passion, heart-consuming
anxiety the companion of our solitude.
Can we imagine it? If so, we shall have
a faint picture of the experiences of many of us
in that terrible May and June.</p>

<p>When the Rajah of Gumilcund heard of the
uprising, his brain seemed to reel with the
shock. His impulse was to go to Meerut himself,
but Chunder Singh dissuaded him. 'The
English,' said this wise minister, 'have troops
enough to defend themselves; and if my lord
were stopped, as he well might be, for the
roads will be infested with evil characters, of
what profit will that be to his friends? My
advice is that we take time to consider, that
we look to ourselves, that we strengthen our
defences and provision the city.'</p>

<p>'You are right. Yes, I acknowledge it.
You are wiser than I am. Call the people
together! Let us have a public council!' cried
the young rajah, springing up. 'If the people side
with me now, they have my affection and gratitude
for ever.'</p>

<p>'They will,' said Chunder Singh.</p>

<p>In the beautiful Dwan-i-Khas, or public hall
of audience, which was a large pillared pavilion,
standing in the midst of an open court, surrounded
by an arcade or corridor, all the principal
people of the city were gathered together
that evening. The court was literally packed.
Within the pavilion, on a marble platform ten
feet high, stood the young rajah, with Chunder
Singh on his right hand, and Vishnugupta on
the left.</p>

<p>Chunder Singh, to whom, as chief minister,
it fell to open the proceedings, was deeply
anxious. His voice trembled as he stood out
and announced, in a few brief words, the calamity
that had happened, with the rajah's orders that
his people should attend to what he had to say
upon the subject. But, in a few moments, his
anxiety was gone, and he looked out before him
with radiant confidence.</p>

<p>The young rajah's speech was admirable.
Fortunately for himself, he had studied not only
the religion and philosophy of this people, but
their history. He stood before them, his mind
stored with pictures out of the past. Better
than anyone in that crowd he knew what the
life of the peninsula had been before the strong
hand of the English, guided by their orderly,
methodical minds, had undertaken to weld the
great chaos of contending states into one peaceful
empire.</p>

<p>Of the internecine warfare that led to Mogul
and Tartar invasions, of the brief prosperity
that, however, did not penetrate to the smaller
states, when the Moslem empire became consolidated
under wise rulers, of the selfish and
cynical policy of Aurungzebe that broke up the
empire, of the horrors that accompanied its
disintegration&mdash;piratical incursions on peaceful
coasts, sackings of wealthy cities, forced contributions
from those who, through industry and
shrewdness, had attained to comfort, languishing
in a slavery worse than death of hundreds of
innocent people, fields ravaged, harvests swept
away, and monuments of antiquity destroyed by
a brutal soldiery&mdash;of these the young rajah
spoke. He spoke quietly; but there was a repressed
power in his voice and manner that told
upon everyone in the assembly. Then, when
their hearts were hot with passionate memories,
and a tremor of vague apprehension was running
through them, he told, in a few brief words,
of the Power that, for these hundred years and
more, had been growing up amongst them.</p>

<p>Here he appealed to the more intelligent
amongst his audience, the wealthy merchants,
and clever artificers, who had made Gumilcund
what she was, and the reasonableness of his
words impressed them.</p>

<p>He did not, he said, seek to deny that it was
the lust of gain which had first brought the English
to their shores. Other nations had come on
the same quest, come and gone so far as their influence
on the national life of India was concerned.
But this nation had stayed. Why? In
answer he bade them follow him while he showed
how the conscience of a great nation had been
struggling with its cupidity, and how conscience
had conquered, so that by degrees the majesty of
might became the majesty of right, till the English
name was a watchword for those who strove to live
righteously, and the English power was a refuge
for the oppressed. Even the late annexations, the
wisdom of which so many called in question,
had been made in the spirit of mercy, and to
stave off the anarchy which would surely have
resulted from the continuance in the peninsula of
selfish and oppressive governments. And what,
he asked, were the men who had been set over
the annexed provinces? Had England sent
from her superfluous population men who desired
only to enrich themselves? No: she had
given India of her best. Brave, true, strong
and noble, denying themselves, and thinking
sternly and simply of their duty, were the citizens
whom she had sent to govern India. 'I speak
what I know,' cried the young rajah, 'for though
I belong to you now, none of you are ignorant
of the fact that England has been the home of
my childhood. I am English and I am Indian,
in a sense which it would be impossible for
me to explain, and I speak with a full knowledge
of the political position of both countries, when
I say that England and India are necessary one
to the other. I need not urge this upon you, my
people, who are, I believe, deeply conscious of
the benefits which have come to us from a strong
and unselfish Imperial government. It is our
desire that this power should be strengthened
rather than weakened, and set on a broader
rather than a narrower basis. But I would that my
voice could resound through the land. I would
that every citizen of this great empire could, at
this awful crisis which some of us believe to
be impending, see on which side his interest and
safety lie. Then the army, which is being led
astray by fanatics, would swiftly return to its
allegiance, and peace and security would again
reign amongst us.' He paused for a moment,
and then his voice rose, and a passion of prophetic
woe seemed to tear, him, as he cried, 'I know
the English; they are fierce when they are roused,
they are dogged when their hearts are set
upon an object, and if they seem to fall back it
will only be for a moment. They will triumph,
and the vengeance they will exact will be in
proportion to their consciousness of rectitude.
Thousands will die the death of felons. Thousands
will lose their all. Thousands will wander
homeless through the land, cursing those who
betrayed them. But that is not all. That is
not even the worst, for death and the flight of
years will dissipate the anguish upon which we
may have to look. The disturbers of our peace
will pass away, and a new generation will arise.
But the sore left behind by the struggle will
remain. The new civilisation, which we so fondly
hoped to establish, will be thrown back. The
seeds of a mutual distrust will be sown, and the
union between East and West, to which my
predecessors looked as enshrining the secret of
the future, and holding within it the promise
of a peace and happiness greater than the world
has ever known, will be indefinitely delayed.
For this,' cried the young orator, his voice
rising and his frame seeming to expand,
'that the calamity which I foresee might be
averted. I could wish that our little Gumilcund
was a million-fold stronger and greater than she
is. To take the van in the great contest which
we see coming, to make for order against
anarchy, to force upon others the views which
we hold ourselves, and which we believe to be
beneficial to us all, to cure the blood-fever which
has seized upon the heart of these unhappy
peoples, and to lead them back into the paths of
reason and quietness&mdash;this we would do if we
had the strength. We know that we have not.
By the Supreme Spirit, which, call it by what
name we will, every one of us acknowledges, our
place amongst the nations has been allotted to
us. We are to this people as a single grain
in a heaped-up storehouse, as a little one in a
multitude. But we can do something, and what
we can do we will. We can be faithful to our
convictions; we can make sacrifices for our
faith; we can govern ourselves; we can be wise,
prudent, firm and watchful. This, which I ask
of myself, I ask of you.' His voice dropped,
and there crept into its tones a curiously soft inflection
as he went on. 'I am new to you, the
tumult of your welcome is still ringing in my ears.
I came to you an unknown man, and you received
me with an honour and distinction such as are
seldom accorded to a stranger. That I owe this
not to my own merits, but to the merits of
those who went before me, I am well aware;
and when I say that it is in response to this
welcome I venture to come forward as your
leader, you will not mistake me. I am speaking
in the name and by the power&mdash;present, as I
believe, at this moment amongst us&mdash;of your
late rajah, done foully to death by the hands and
heads that are plotting this rising. Tell me then
what your desire is. Let us confer together
about the measures we should take for the
proper defence of this city. Let us agree to open
our gates to the fugitive and to shut them to the
oppressor; and, whatever may be in the future,
we shall have our reward, for we shall have
within us what a Western scripture would call
"the answer of a good conscience towards God
and towards men," or, in the not less striking
words of the Bhagavad Gita, the sacred lore,
the divine wisdom, "worshipping by the performance
of our duties Him from whom is the
endeavour of men, we shall attain perfection."'</p>

<h4>HOOSANEE'S MISSION</h4>


<p>So ran the speech which the young rajah of
Gumilcund addressed to his people on that
memorable night. The effect was tremendous.
As from one man the voices of the multitude
rose in shouts of applause. 'It is the voice of
the dead. Byrajee Pirtha Raj, our father, has
come back to us from the grave. We will do
his bidding.' So the tumultuous cries rang
out.</p>

<p>Presently a herald went down amongst them,
and imposed silence. Their rajah was pleased
with their warm reception of his address; but
business and not acclamation was the purpose
of their coming together. There fell then a
great silence on the assembly, in the midst of
which the rich men and elders of the city came
forward and proffered their help. The working
guilds followed&mdash;manipulators of metal and
precious stones, finance agents, masons, and
provision dealers, from amongst each of which
the rajah chose out one to represent the others,
so that, in addition to his official retinue, he
might have about him a council conversant not
only with the wants but with the resources of
the city. Surrounded by these, he left the
Dwan-i-Khas and entered the Dwan-i-amm,
Vishnugupta the priest charging himself with
the task of dismissing the greater multitude.</p>

<p>All night long the young rajah and his
people sat up in counsel, and when the morning
of the 12th of May dawned, that day which
in distant Delhi was to witness such terrible
scenes, their measures were taken. The rich
men contributed money; the mechanics promised
their labour; volunteers offered themselves to
reinforce the little army, and a special band of
trustworthy soldiers were told off as the bodyguard
of the rajah. It was universally determined
that, if the mutineers came to Gumilcund,
they should have a warm reception.</p>

<p>On the following day the rajah drew up an
address, which, after being signed by himself
and the principal men of the state, was to be
forwarded to the Lieutenant Governor of the
province. In it the loyalty of the state was set
forth, and a refuge within the walls of its chief
city was offered to any of the English ladies and
children who might be thought to occupy
positions of peril.</p>

<p>The public address was accompanied by a
communication from himself of a much more
urgent character. The Lieutenant-Governor,
who had lately, he said, done him the honour
of congratulating him on his accession, was
well aware of the fact that, although an Indian
rajah, he was more than half an Englishman.
Nevertheless, owing no doubt to his position, he
had gained an insight into native character
which, he believed, was rare amongst English-speaking
people. It was his profound conviction
that what he had seen and heard was
only the beginning of troubles, and he implored
the English authorities to take their precautions.
Then he reiterated his offer of refuge,
mentioning several stations, amongst which were
Jhansi and Nowgong, as to his certain knowledge
eminently unsafe.</p>

<p>The letter was sent, and duly acknowledged.
Whether it was believed or not, he never knew.
Possibly, he said to himself, with a bitter smile,
it was looked upon as a blind to hide some deep
design.</p>

<p>As a fact, his offer was made known to those
most nearly concerned, the civil and military
officers of the suspected districts, and they
smiled at it. They did not want a man more
than half a native to instruct them as to their
duties. Their chief duty was to preserve the
allegiance of the troops, and if they sent away
the ladies, those susceptible beings would be
justly offended&mdash;precipitated, in fact, into the
very jaws of ruin. The people at Jhansi were
specially tickled by the solicitude of a foreign
ruler on their behalf. They, with such an ally
and friend as the good Ranee, whose affection
for the English was well-known, to show themselves
afraid! It was ridiculous. Such pusillanimity
would meet with its proper desert in the
alienation of the faithful and the triumph of
the mutineers.</p>

<p>So the Rajah of Gumilcund was answered, as
were Sindia, Holkar, and Dinkur Rao, with calm
reserve; and if one or two poor mothers, as they
clasped their children in their arms, wished that
the chiefs could have seen it fit to send the
little ones away, they bowed to the inevitable
and tried to believe that all would be well. As
for our rajah, he gnashed his teeth with impotent
rage, for, with the answer to his letter and
address, came like a grim commentary the echoes
of the explosion at Delhi.</p>

<p>He had as yet heard no details. Sick with
anxiety for his friends and compatriots in the
now hostile city, he was compelled to hold himself
in check, and attend to the business of the
hour. Now and then, amidst his many preoccupations,
the vision of pretty Vivien Doncaster,
as he had seen her last, driving carelessly
and proudly through a crowd whose cringing
servility filled her with contempt, would return
to his mind, making it reel with a curious, indescribable
passion. Heaven knew he did not
wish to humble her; but&mdash;and there, not being
able so much as to formulate his wish, we
would fling the thought of her aside.</p>

<p>It was with a very different feeling that he
thought of others&mdash;Aglaia and her delicate
mother, in the very heart of the district which
he knew to be unsafe; and Mrs. Lyster, whom
he had seen for a few moments, but without her
recognising him, in the English quarter of
Futtehgarh; above all, Grace! He had ascertained
that she was at Nowgong, a small station
about equidistant from Gumilcund and Jhansi,
and garrisoned with detachments from the
Jhansi regiments.</p>

<p>In addition to his public body of advisers,
Tom had an inner council, consisting of Chunder
Singh, Hoosanee, and others of tried faithfulness.
Through these men he had organised a
secret service commission, which came and went,
bringing him certain news of the progress of
affairs in the solitary English stations scattered
amongst the native dependent states of the
Central Indian Agency. It was in this way that
he heard of the ardent profession of loyalty
made by the garrison at Nowgong when it was
known that insurrection was stalking abroad
through the land, and of the relief and confidence
amongst the little English community there. He
knew, too, that Jhansi had made no sign, and
that the Ranee was, or appeared to be, more
friendly than ever. All this blinded neither him
nor his advisers.</p>

<p>While they made use of the breathing-space
afforded to them by putting everything in the
city on a war-footing, Tom succeeded in conveying
a warning to Grace and her cousin.</p>

<p>It happened on this wise.</p>

<p>Hoosanee, who could read his young master's
mind like an open book, perceiving that this
enterprise was of deep moment to him, and
wishing on his own account to be brought in
contact with the young Englishwoman, for whose
sake, as the shrewd servant believed, the rajah
had resisted the blandishments of the fairest and
most fascinating women in India, determined to
undertake the mission himself.</p>

<p>In the garb of a merchant travelling from
station to station with specimens of the pretty
garnet and silver ornaments for which Gumilcund
is famous, he left the city late one night. He was
alone; but, as he dressed poorly, carried little
of value with him, and travelled at night and
by the most unfrequented routes, he met with
no hindrance. Between night and morning on
the third day after he left his home he entered
Nowgong. This done, it was a matter of little
difficulty to gain access to the verandah of the
small bungalow where, he had found out by careful
inquiry, the little mem sahib Robertson and
her big sister lived. He was in the verandah just
after dawn. The chuprassie, believing him to
be a respectable man, accepted a small fee, and
the promise of a good commission if the visit
resulted in business, for the corner of the
verandah, where he allowed him to seat himself.</p>

<p>Here, then, Hoosanee took up his position.
He squatted on his heels, after the Indian
fashion, his face a mask, his long fingers busy
with the small wares, which he had arranged
against a background of azure blue satin in the
most attractive fashion possible, and his ears
and eyes on the alert.</p>

<p>Presently a calm, contemplative person in
tunic, dhootie, gay crimson sash and turban,
crossed the verandah and spoke to the chuprassie,
who called out in authoritative tones for the
Captain Sahib's horse. It came up, and a young
Englishman in military uniform crossed the
verandah. He did not look in the best of
tempers. Muttering in English that these morning
parades were the very mischief, he threw an
angry word to the groom, who was trying in
vain to check the fidgetiness of the horse, asked
the chuprassie how much those fools of pedlars
gave him for allowing them to hang about the
compound, flung himself on his horse, and rode
off at a quick trot. Two serious persons were
busy meantime over a small table in the verandah.
They laid it out with delicate china, brought in a
steaming urn, and plates of fruit and cake, and
waited with folded arms and melancholy countenances
for their sahib-log to appear. In a few
moments Hoosanee, who sat like an image in his
corner, heard the sound of rippling laughter,
followed by a rush of light garments through
the house. A little white dog came bounding
on to the verandah. It saw the stranger in the
corner, and ran back barking vigorously.
'What's the matter, Vick?' said a small silvery
voice. 'Ah!' as the owner of the voice, a
pretty little woman with flaxen hair and soft
blue eyes, came out upon the verandah. 'It's
another of those pedlars. With garnets too! I
love garnets!'</p>

<p>Hoosanee rose and bowed low. The little
lady, who could only stammer a few words of
Hindustani, asked him where he came from, and
when he answered humbly that he was a poor
man, who had no fixed home, but that the
ornaments were entrusted to him by a merchant
from Gumilcund, she nodded her pretty head.</p>

<p>'See about you after breakfast,' she said.
'Have you eaten this morning? Oh! by the
bye,' in English, 'these people don't like you to
know anything about their meals. I forgot
that. Where did you say you came from?'
again in halting Hindustani.</p>

<p>'My garnets come from Gumilcund, noble
lady,' said Hoosanee.</p>

<p>'Gumilcund! Gumilcund!' murmured the
little lady, gazing at him and thrusting forward
her under lip. 'Now, where have I heard of that
place? Was it&mdash;oh, yes! I remember. Grace
saw the rajah at Delhi. Handsome fellow, like
an Englishman she once met. As if a native
could ever be like an Englishman. But Grace
has such funny ideas.'</p>

<p>All this Hoosanee, who had studied the
English language in the rajah's school at Gumilcund,
understood perfectly.</p>

<p>The little lady ran back into the house,
crying out, 'Grace! Grace! Come quickly!
There's a man with garnets here; such beauties!'
And, in the next moment, a young and very
beautiful woman came out. From his corner
Hoosanee looked at her. He had seen Englishwomen
before, and some of them had been fair
of countenance and of stately presence. But
he had never seen one to match her who stood
gazing at him now. At <i>him</i>&mdash;not at his wares,
as her little friend had done&mdash;that was what
was strange to the Indian servant. Diplomatist
as he was, and skilled in hiding his feelings, he
could not keep the curious tremor which her
questioning gaze excited in him from appearing
in his face. His eyes dropped, and when he
looked up again she had turned away. 'Come
to breakfast, Lucy,' she said. 'I am sure the
good man can wait. He has patience written in
his face. By the bye' (looking round), 'where
is Tikaram?'</p>

<p>Tikaram was the chuprassie. He had been
keeping out of sight, for fear of being called in
question about the salesman in the verandah;
but hearing his name spoken in Grace's friendly
tones, he stepped forward. 'Tikaram,' she said
kindly, 'will you mind going into the village for
me? If it is too far to walk, you can take my
pony.'</p>

<p>'Too far! What a little molly-coddle you
are with these servants, Grace,' interposed
Lucy. 'You spoil them! Let me give the order.
I know enough Hindustani&mdash;servants' Hindustani,
which is what they understand.'</p>

<p>'My dear Lucy, allow me! I like to speak
in my own way,' said Grace. She gave her
order, which was that a certain small account
should be paid, and Tikaram, bowing low, turned
away; but, before he went, he glanced at the
salesman in the corner.</p>

<p>'We will keep him till you come back,' said
Grace, with a smile, for she knew the customs
of the country, and believed that the small
backsheesh which Tikaram might exact for his
favour would not be a heavy toll.</p>

<p>They sat and chatted together in low tones.
Hoosanee did not catch all they said; but he
judged that they were anxious. Suddenly
Grace, whom her cousin accused of being in a
fidgety humour, thought of another errand, and
the table-servant vanished. The bearer was
sent after him, so that, before they had finished
their breakfast, there was no one about but the
ayah, who was squatted in the corner of the
verandah, opposite to that occupied by Hoosanee,
watching him sleepily.</p>

<p>To see the two English ladies alone was
precisely what Hoosanee wanted. He now
waited their pleasure with a lighter heart.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, they approached his corner,
and while Lucy fingered his trinkets, asking the
price of one and another, Grace continued to
look at him earnestly. He ventured now to
allow his eyes to respond. Then he said in a
low voice, 'Does my noble lady understand
Bengali?' The question was asked in the Bengali
dialect.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Grace, quietly. 'Are you from
Bengal?'</p>

<p>'What gibberish are you talking now?' interposed
Lucy, discontentedly. 'Do let us keep
to business. Tell me the price of this?' holding
up a pretty little garnet brooch.</p>

<p>'<i>Tin rupya</i>,' said the man, spreading out
three of his long fingers.</p>

<p>'Too little if they're real&mdash;too much if
they're not,' said Lucy in English. Then in
Hindustani, with a little affectation of sternness,
'If you cheat me I will have you put in prison.'</p>

<p>'Why not take it into the house and compare
it with my garnet necklace?' said Grace.
'Ayah will show you where it is.'</p>

<p>'Not a bad idea,' said Lucy.</p>

<p>She went in, the ayah following her, and
Grace said hurriedly, in the dialect in which
the salesman had just spoken, 'You have come
to speak to us. From whom?'</p>

<p>'From one who wishes my noble lady well,'
said Hoosanee. He paused, and then, 'Will my
lady deign to look at these poor baubles instead
of at her servant? In these evil days the leaves
and the flowers have eyes.'</p>

<p>'Not here,' said Grace. 'Our servants, I
am sure, would be faithful, for we have treated
them well, and they love us; and the soldiers of
the station have professed their goodwill and
devotion. We did not ask them. They came
forward of their own accord; if'&mdash;her large eyes
distending&mdash;'I were only as sure of the safety of
others as I am of our own, I should be happy.
But we are strangely cut off here.'</p>

<p>They were continuing the little pantomime
which the salesman had originated, and their
voices were low and even.</p>

<p>'My noble lady is wrong,' he said, holding up
one of his brooches to the light. 'Does the
eagle who looks into the face of the sun behold,
far below him, the fowler with his snare? Does
the king of the forest, roaming at his will, see in
the jungle the iron teeth gaping to devour him?'</p>

<p>'What do you mean, and who are you?'
cried Grace. 'I am sure you are no mere
salesman.'</p>

<p>'Such as I am, does my noble lady trust me?'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes. I cannot tell myself why, but I
do. It seems to me that I have seen your face
before.'</p>

<p>'Could it have been at Lucknow? I was
with my master there.'</p>

<p>'At the door of the Dilkoosha,' cried Grace
excitedly. 'Yes, I remember. Your master was
the man in the long chuddah, who was watching
the crowd. I saw his face when he looked at
Sir Henry. It was as a man looks in prayer.
He came into the reception afterwards.'</p>

<p>'Miss Sahib has a good memory,' said
Hoosanee; 'but let me entreat her to speak
with more caution!'</p>

<p>'Caution! Caution!' said the poor girl. 'I
shall die of caution. I wish no ill to these
people. Why should they wish ill to me?'</p>

<p>'Even because of your goodness&mdash;and your
beauty,' said Hoosanee in a low voice.</p>

<p>Grace trembled. But before she could speak
again Lucy came running out. 'What an untidy
girl you are, Grace!' she said. 'Ayah and I
hunted everywhere for your necklace, and found
it at last in your bath-room. You deserve to be
robbed, and only that these people are ten times
better than they are painted you would be.'</p>

<p>'But how about the stones?' said Grace,
making an effort to speak lightly.</p>

<p>'Well! I think they are all right. They
look very much the same. But I am such a
little idiot about these things, and so are you, my
dear&mdash;worse, I think&mdash;because you believe everybody.
Oh, dear! I do wish I could have a
trustworthy opinion.'</p>

<p>'Mrs. Durant is considered a good judge of
Indian jewellery,' said Grace.</p>

<p>'Why, of course she is,' cried Lucy, clapping
her hands. 'You have a head, if you have
nothing else; I will say that for you, Grace.
And I wanted to hear how Colonel Durant was
received by the troops this morning. Ayah,
tell them to bring round the palki-gharry at
once. Too late!' in answer to a mild protest
from Grace. 'Why the sun isn't up yet&mdash;and
I'll try to bring her back with me, shall I? She
has just arrived, and has something to talk of
besides servants and mutineers.'</p>

<p>'Do!' said Grace; 'and bring my little
lover, Kit, too, if you can. I will keep the
pedlar.'</p>

<p>In a few moments Lucy, accompanied by her
ayah, drove off, and Grace turned her pale face
to Hoosanee. 'Go on,' she said. 'Your master
has sent you. He is the Rajah of Gumilcund.'</p>

<p>'You are right, most noble lady. My master,
the rajah, has sent me. He has only lately
come to rule over us; but already he knows
the hearts of his people. He loves the English,
and he would, if he could, avert these troubles.
But he knows it to be impossible. The storm
has broken, and it will sweep over the land and
devastate it, and none can stay its course. This
he bids me tell you, beseeching you to seek a
refuge while you can.'</p>

<p>'That is easy to say,' said Grace faintly.
'But where are we to seek a refuge, and to whom
is it offered? Flight was spoken of before; but
we have been assured that, if we leave the station
now, it will displease the men, who have again and
again promised to be loyal, and so revolt would be
hastened. God knows,' she went on passionately,
'that it is hard to wait. When I think of them
all&mdash;my poor little cousin, who will not believe
in danger, and that beautiful child, and the
young men and women&mdash;it is like a burden at
my heart. I can scarcely breathe. I seem to
see all sorts of horrible things; and,' slowly,
'horrible things have happened already. It is
no dream.'</p>

<p>'They have happened; they will happen
again. But you, most noble lady, could escape.
Could you&mdash;would you trust yourself to me?'
Hoosanee spoke breathlessly.</p>

<p>'Alone?' said Grace, drawing back..</p>

<p>'No, not alone. I could arrange for the
escape of two, perhaps of three.'</p>

<p>For a few moments Grace sat silent, with
bended head, thinking; and the rajah's messenger
watched her with a beating heart. He was thinking
a little of himself, of the triumph it would be
to enter Gumilcund as the protector and deliverer
of the first of the English fugitives, of
her, in particular, on whom his master's heart
was set. But he thought of her too. He in
his own humble way had fallen in love with the
beautiful and gentle lady, whose manner to
natives was so different from that practised by
the generality of her countrywomen. He knew,
moreover, as even his master could not, how
cruel and shameless an Eastern mob could be;
and the idea of her falling alive into the hands
of the mutineers made him sick with horror.
Hoosanee, we must remember, belonged to
Gumilcund. Except during the last few months,
when he had served the new rajah, who was much
gentler in his manners to those depending upon
him than any grandee of the East, he had never
been brought into direct contact with English
people. The bitter, personal hatred, compounded
partly of race and religious antagonism, and
partly of spite for a long series of small wrongs
and humiliations&mdash;the hatred which made servants
betray their masters and mistresses, and
peasants gloat over the misery and degradation
of Englishwomen, and villagers flog Englishmen
in the presence of jeering crowds&mdash;was strange
to him. But he knew that it existed, and the
knowledge made him shudder for the fair woman
his master loved.</p>

<p>Presently Grace looked up. 'We are not
many,' she said. 'Would it be possible for us
all to escape? The men, I believe, would be
freer without us.'</p>

<p>'I could return for the others,' said Hoosanee,
evasively.</p>

<p>'I think we might persuade my cousin to
go, and sweet little Kit and his mother,' said
Grace.</p>

<p>'Will my noble lady pardon me?' said
Hoosanee, bending low. 'She must come first,
or I must return whence I came alone.'</p>

<p>Grace looked at him as if she did not quite
understand what he said. He repeated his
words, speaking with a still deeper humility.</p>

<p>'Is it so?' said Grace, raising her head
proudly. 'To save myself I must desert
them?'</p>

<p>'In saving yourself, most noble, you will
save others.'</p>

<p>'I will save all, or I will save none,' said
Grace in a low voice.</p>

<p>At this moment the palki-gharry drove up,
and a beautiful little boy, with long golden curls&mdash;like
a girl, sprang out and leapt into Grace's
arms. 'Why, my Kit,' she said softly, 'my
little Kit!'</p>

<p>'We're going to stay all day,' he cried,
'mother and me. Where's Vick? Oh, there she
is! Mayn't I go and play with her?'</p>

<p>'Yes, darling, run and play,' said Grace,
releasing him.</p>

<p>A pale-faced lady, in a white dress and large
straw hat, was in the meantime stepping out of
the gharry. Lucy followed her. Both of them,
Grace thought, looked scared.</p>

<p>'Well,' she said, smiling, 'have you asked
Mrs. Durant about the garnets?'</p>

<p>'Send the man away,' said Lucy, pettishly.
'They have all been scolding me; Captain
Durant, and Mr. Graham, and Mrs. Cockburn,
and even Emily,' turning to Mrs. Durant. 'They
say I ought not to have left you alone with a
man like that. I'm sure one doesn't know what
to do. If you're frightened, that's wrong; and if
you try to forget things a little, and be cheerful,
you're heartless. I wish I was dead and out of
it all.'</p>

<p>'So would I if it were not for the child,' said
Mrs. Durant. 'Grace! Grace! do you think
they would have the heart to do anything to
him?'</p>

<p>'We won't give them the opportunity,' said
Grace, firmly. 'If the worst comes to the worst
we will escape. I will find a means.'</p>

<p>They smiled. These were brave words; but
the peril was not actually upon them. And yet,
for what reason neither of them could tell, they
felt encouraged. Grace was one of those who
inspired confidence.</p>

<p>'Well,' said Mrs. Durant, with a stifled sob,
'if it is to be done I hope they'll do it quickly.
Only for Kit, I don't think I'd mind so much.
Charlie is so cross, and they come in with such
dreadful tales, and the servants scowl at him
when he scolds them; and he won't&mdash;he won't
see that it would be so much wiser to conciliate
everybody. Only for Kit I couldn't bear it!
You see,' with a rainbow-like change, 'he has
his curls still.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Grace, smiling. 'I thought you
would not have the heart to shear Kit's curls.
But come! you are both tired. Leave Vick
and him to me, and go in and have a rest.'</p>

<p>'But how about the man?' said Lucy.</p>

<p>'Oh, he is a good simple soul! I will buy
one or two of his trinkets and dismiss him.'</p>

<p>A few minutes later the salesman left the
compound. He looked all round him carefully,
and chanced upon Tikaram, pacing back slowly
on his mistress's pony. Both of them pulled
up.</p>

<p>'I was looking for you, O brother,' said
Hoosanee. 'The sale has been good, and she
of the lotus eyes has charged her servant to
return. Here is backsheesh for my brother's
good will.'</p>

<p>Tikaram, though surprised at the generosity
of the gift, took it carelessly.</p>

<p>'Their raj is nearly done,' he said, jerking
his thumb in the direction of the bungalow.
'The treasures of the land will now be for its
own, and not for the sons and daughters of
strangers. But the lotus-eyed has a soft tongue
and a noble presence.' He spoke meditatively,
almost sadly.</p>

<p>'I know nothing of your politics,' said Hoosanee,
indifferently; 'I am a poor man, and I
love those who bring me gain.'</p>

<p>'Then come back our way,' said Tikaram,
'and I will keep the lotus-eyed for thee&mdash;if she
is not by that time food for her masters.'</p>

<p>'Will my brother keep her?' said Hoosanee,
his face brightening as if a new idea had struck
him.</p>

<p>'I might,' said Tikaram.</p>

<p>'I have a master who is a prince. He
would give a lakh of rupees for the two women
and the child.'</p>

<p>'A lakh!' said Tikaram, his mouth watering.</p>

<p>'A lakh of rupees if they were given to him
unhurt.'</p>

<p>'But three! What can he want with
three?'</p>

<p>'Who knows? Great men have their caprices,
and if they will pay for them, let the
little keep silence! Perhaps he will keep a
museum, and show them as curiosities when the
English are all swept into the sea. But this is
what he said: "Bring me three of these English&mdash;a
small woman, a large woman, and a child
with golden hair. Let them be well nourished,
and of fair countenance. I will pay a lakh to
thee for thy trouble, and another lakh to the
man who helps thee." What does my brother
say?'</p>

<p>'I would save the lotus-eyed without money,'
said Tikaram, and then he turned away. 'There
is time, O brother; they have not risen yet,' he
murmured.</p>

<h4>GENERAL ELTON'S MARCH</h4>


<p>Hoosanee did more good work at Nowgong.
Professing to be a discontented native official
from Gumilcund, he insinuated himself into the
confidence of the two or three uneasy spirits in
the station, and made one of them promise to communicate
with him when matters should seem
ripe for a revolt. He was relieved to find that
the discontented were in a minority, and that
they had no present hope of increasing their
numbers, or of being able to take any decided
step. As it was in Nowgong, so it was elsewhere.
Whether from fear of the vengeance
that seemed so strangely to halt, or from some
remnant of right feeling, it is impossible to say.
Possibly the revolt at Meerut, hurried on by the
punishment of mutineers, and the consequent
taking of Delhi, took the native as well as the
English army in India by surprise. However
this may have been, it is certain that, between
the middle of May and the beginning of June,
there was a lull, during which the scattered
groups of English, who were absolutely in the
power of native troops, took heart once more.
A body of Ghoorka soldiers, sent across the
Nepaul border to strengthen the hands of the
English, under command of that gallant young
soldier, Gambier Singh, was recalled by the
Governor's orders, and a proclamation, promising
pardon to the mutineers who had not actually
taken part in the murder of Europeans, was
issued.</p>

<p>This last was a most disastrous step. No
one understanding the nature of Asiatics could
have taken it. The mutinous troops and agitators,
staggered by their own successes, and
secretly dreading the vengeance of the White
Man, whom they had insulted and defied, began
now to breathe more freely. The White Man was
afraid, or he would not seek to propitiate them.
And who could wonder? They were but a little
number in the land, and England, which at best
was a small country, and hemmed in, as some
of them had heard, by hosts of enemies, was
hundreds of miles away across a stormy sea.
Let them but be true to their colours for a short
time, and the word of prophecy would be fulfilled.
The raj of the stranger-race would pass away
for ever.</p>

<p>Thinking thus, they were ready to bide their
time and do nothing rashly.</p>

<p>It was this lull which threw dust in the eyes
of the English officers.</p>

<p>One of these was General Elton.</p>

<p>He had, as it happened, no distinct command.
What his personal influence might have effected
if he had been at Meerut when the storm broke
it is impossible to say. He might have shamed
the authorities into action, and saved the honour
of the English name. But he was absent, in
pursuance of the mission that had been entrusted
to him. As an old regimental and brigade
officer, supposed to be well versed in the native
character, he had been deputed, on the first
rumour of discontent in the army, to travel
through the North-West Provinces and the
Central Indian Agency, examining into grievances,
and reporting on the general condition of
the troops.</p>

<p>On the terrible Sunday afternoon when the
storm broke he was at Jhansi, enjoying the
hospitality of the Ranee, and conferring with her
on the curious portents of the time. They were
actually together when the news came, and the
General, who prided himself on his knowledge
of character, was more than satisfied by her
surprise and indignation.</p>

<p>Alarmed for his safety, she entreated him
to remain at Jhansi until he could obtain more
certain news, but the General, while touched by
her solicitude, would not hear of delay. He
took horse at once, and, surrounded by the
small body of English soldiers with whom he
had been travelling, set out on a forced march
to Meerut.</p>

<p>A tremendous march it was, and fuller of
peril, than any one of the little band imagined!
Their audacity served them for strength. Those
who plotted their destruction hesitated to strike,
for some at least must fall victims to these
watchful and resolute men. Besides, who could
say that an army was not marching at their
heels? As, in their dress of scarlet and gold
with their sabres flashing in the sun, the General
and his guard rode through the country, every
one made way for them. From the villages,
hostile as many of them were, and infested with
<i>budmashes</i> and disbanded soldiers, they had no
difficulty in obtaining supplies. To many of
the workers of mischief, the gallant old soldier,
with his hard face, keen sight and short sharp
words of command, came as the first of the
avengers, while those amongst ourselves who
saw him ride by were inspired with fresh confidence.</p>

<p>I was one of these. I was exercising the
sullen-looking handful of troops for which I was
responsible, on the parade-ground outside our
station, when the General passed. He halted
for a few moments and watched us. I and my men
saluted, and it seemed to me that they drew
themselves together and stepped out more briskly.</p>

<p>I looked at him&mdash;a small man, muscles tense,
face stern, lips set firmly together, blue eyes, full
of fire and energy, looking out steadily. He
was in full-dress uniform, all his accoutrements
as spotless as if he were on court parade at home.
He rode a little Arab horse, well-fed and groomed,
and as highly bred as himself. 'Game to the
very finger-tips,' so I said to myself, as I
looked at him. While England had such men
as the General in reserve, our raj would not
pass away. The General rode on. In spite of
the fearful anxiety which, as we all knew, was
consuming him, he did his duty gallantly. He
called at the most important stations on the
route, at Gwalior, Agra, Mynpoorie and Secunderabad,
doing what he could to encourage the
loyal and to awe the discontented. But to Delhi,
the most important of them all, he was obliged
to give a wide berth, for he knew that the rebels
were congregating there in force.</p>

<p>It was nearing the end of the month before
he reached the neighbourhood of Meerut. He
had not, in the meantime, met any of the English
force. He had not so much as heard
of it; and he grew more and more troubled
and perplexed. Was, then, the awful tale which
he had heard true? Were his countrymen
taken so completely by surprise that not one of
them was left alive to fight for the honour of
his country? A thousand soldiers, Englishmen
all of them! It was impossible. And there
was one native regiment at Meerut which he
had made up his mind would be faithful. He
had commanded it himself for years. Its native
officers were veterans, men of high birth and
fine breeding, who had fought by his side in
many a frontier war. One of them had saved
his life at the imminent risk of his own, and to
the General he had long been as a personal
friend. He would almost as readily have believed
in his own failure from duty as in Sufder
Jung's. As for the men, he had called them his
children. Big children and little children, the
old men, who were recruits when he took up
the command, and who had learned under him
the warrior's art, and the young men, only
lately enrolled, who were learning it from others,
he loved them all. Riding through the desolate
plain, with the fierce rays of an Indian sun
beating upon him, and this awful thing at his
heart, the old man felt a curious moisture
bedewing his eyes. Only a few weeks before
he had held a review of all arms at Meerut,
and his pet regiment had distinguished itself
beyond all the others. Like a picture it flashed
before him, the noble stature, proud carriage,
flashing eyes and perfect accoutrement, and
again, sweeter than the incense of flattery, there
fell upon his ears the shouts of applause which
broke forth on every side, as, at a double-quick
march, but moving with the precision of a
machine, his children swept by the saluting point.
'Efficiency could not be carried further,' he
had said, shaking hands warmly with the colonel
of the regiment. 'I congratulate you.' And now
to hear it said that these men were disloyal, that
then, when they were responding with joyful
shouts to the shouts of their English comrades,
they were actually plotting to betray them! It
could not, it should not be.</p>

<p>With stern face the General rode on. No
one molested them; but, in the deserted huts
and silent villages, in the procession along the
road of trains of frightened peasants, men and
women, with all their household utensils about
them, and in the occasional presence of bands
of ragged, fierce-looking men, armed with clubs
and ancient rifles, he saw ominous signs of disorder
and panic.</p>

<p>They came at last to within five miles of
Meerut. No one came out to meet them, although
the General had sent forward native
scouts, nor could they hear anything of the
English troops. It was now the hottest hour
of the afternoon, and the men, who had been in
the saddle since early morning, were dead beat.
Not knowing what they might have to meet at
Meerut, the General, desperately anxious as he
was to be at his goal, determined to call a halt.
There was a little grove of mango and neem
trees a few yards from the road. He led his
men thither, and while some were set to watch,
the others, exhausted by their long ride under
the burning sun, emptied their drinking-flasks and
flung themselves down for an hour's rest.</p>

<p>The General was amongst the watchers. He
would not even unsaddle. He stood by his
horse, his left arm flung over its neck, and his
right grasping a loaded revolver, while his wide-open,
sleepless eyes were piercing the recesses of
the wood. For an hour he watched. There
was no disturbance, nothing to break the deep
silence of the camping-ground. Then his men
changed guard. One of them, his personal servant,
came up to him and entreated that he also
would rest for an hour. But the General refused,
and again there was silence.</p>

<p>Evening was drawing on. His eyes had
begun to smart with the long strain of watchfulness,
and it was on the tip of his tongue to
give the order to saddle and mount, when his
practised ear caught the sound of stealthy
movement in the wood.</p>

<p>'Some one is skulking about the ground,' he
said to the nearest trooper, 'perhaps a messenger
from Meerut. Beat round cautiously and find out!'</p>

<p>The man disappeared amongst the withered
underwood, and emerged a few moments later
with a tall figure, shrouded from head to foot in
a white chuddah, at his heels.</p>

<p>'Who are you?' said the General, 'and
what are you doing here?'</p>

<p>At his word the chuddah dropped, and he
saw the uniform of his own favourite regiment,
while, in the next moment, he recognised the
dark features of the officer who had saved his
life in battle so many years before.</p>

<p>'Sufder Jung!' he said reproachfully. 'You
here! Where are your children?'</p>

<p>Sobbing like a child the man prostrated
himself on the ground. 'Let not my General
look at me so!' he cried. 'Is it my fault that
they rebelled?'</p>

<p>'They <i>have</i> rebelled?' said the General,
drawing a deep breath.</p>

<p>'Not all, my General. There is a detachment
which is faithful yet.'</p>

<p>'In Meerut?'</p>

<p>'No, my General. They forced us away
with them, and to save our lives, we went on&mdash;escaping
one by one, and banding ourselves together,
for we hoped in a few days to meet
your Excellency. But before we went we provided
for the escape of those in your Excellency's
house, the mem Sahib, and the Miss Sahibs.
The house was on fire and the fiends were
yelling round it, crying to the servants to throw
out to them the Sahib-log, and let them deal
with them as they would. We forced them
away and put out the flames, and carried the
ladies to a place of safety within the walls.
One was hurt. I know not which. I carried
her in my arms and she moaned with pain.'</p>

<p>A groan broke from the General. 'This
is true?' he said; 'you are not deceiving
me?'</p>

<p>'True by the Prophet's beard, your
Excellency! Why should Sufder Jung deceive
you?'</p>

<p>'But where were our own troops? Did
they look on like frightened children?'</p>

<p>'The English were taken by surprise, your
Excellency.'</p>

<p>'Do you mean to tell me they were slain,
every one of them?'</p>

<p>'Pardon me, my General. Some were
killed; but there are still a thousand men
within the walls of the city.'</p>

<p>'A thousand, within the walls, doing nothing!
Now I know that you are lying, Sufder Jung.'</p>

<p>'Let his Excellency have patience, and he
will see whether his servant has spoken the
truth. I hear, from friends of my own, that to-morrow
a detachment will set out for Delhi.'</p>

<p>'To-morrow!' burst out the General. 'To-morrow!
and how long has Delhi been in the
hands of the rebels, Sufder Jung?'</p>

<p>'It was on the 11th of May that the
rebels rushed out of Meerut. If his Excellency
will believe me, they were like a herd of
frightened sheep. I and my men could have
taken them all, without help from the English,
if the whole of my troop had stood firm. They
entered the Imperial city on the 12th.'</p>

<p>'And it is now the 23rd. A fortnight
lost&mdash;lost in inaction!' said the General. 'By
heaven it may cost us the raj! And we
deserve it.' But here, remembering to whom
he was speaking, he pulled himself up. 'I
speak hastily,' he said. 'No doubt the General
in command had reasons of state, about which
we know nothing. You, in any case, have done
well to come to me. What boon would you
have, Sufder Jung? Will you join my bodyguard,
until I can find you a command?'</p>

<p>'If I were alone, your Excellency,' said
Sufder Jung, joining the palms of his hands together
and bowing low, 'I would ask to be made
your Honour's servant, and I would follow to
the ends of the earth. But I am not alone.
A little remnant of our troop has remained
faithful. They are crying out to be led against
their mutinous brethren; but some of them are
fearful lest their professions of faithfulness be
discredited. They are encamped not far from
here. It is their hope to re-enter the city of
Meerut under the protection of his Excellency.
Will not my lord see and comfort them?'</p>

<p>By this time the English soldiers constituting
the body-guard, several of whom had been
near enough to the General to hear every word
that had passed between him and Sufder Jung,
were closing round them, and an angry murmur
rose from their ranks. The General caught it
and looked round on them sternly. His personal
servant stood near him. 'Beg your
pardon, sir,' he said, saluting. 'We didn't mean
no harm like; but&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'But what?' thundered the General. 'Go
on, now you have begun!'</p>

<p>'Them pandies isn't to be trusted, sir&mdash;not
a mother's son of them all.'</p>

<p>'You know so much about them, Tommy,'
said the General. 'How long have you been in
India?'</p>

<p>'Six months, sir.'</p>

<p>'And you?' to another.</p>

<p>'Same time, General.'</p>

<p>'Six months' service, and you can judge the
people in this sweeping way! Bravo, my men!
Now, I have spent thirty years of my life in
India. I have marched for hundreds of miles
with the men whom you despise, and they have
fought by my side like gallant gentlemen. I
have lived with them in times of peace as a
father lives with his sons. I have called them
my children. Again and again, I have owed my
life to their care. Here is one,' pointing to the
Soubahdar, 'who interposed with his own body
between me and destruction. And yet, I confess,'
his strong voice faltered, 'I do not understand
them as I thought I did, or as I should wish
to do. This that has happened is a mystery to me.
I cannot fathom it. But that all are faithless,
that a man like Soubahdar Sufder Jung should
come to his general with affection on his lips
and black treachery at his heart, this I can
never believe. Stand back, while I hear what
more he has to tell me.'</p>

<p>Reluctantly the men fell back, while the
Soubahdar, who, understanding part but not
all of this discourse, had been standing aside,
with bowed head and streaming eyes, approached
the General again, and spoke in a voice so low
that none of the English soldiers could catch
what he said.</p>

<p>Presently the General addressed them. His
face was radiant, and his voice was strong and
full. 'Wait for me here, my men,' he said,
'but be ready to start at the word of command.
We have friends and comrades close by. I will
join you with them in less than half-an-hour.'</p>

<p>This time no one, not even the General's servant,
ventured on a word of protest, for the
will of the old soldier was known to be like
iron; but as, the Soubahdar riding at his right
hand, he went off slowly to where the wood was
thickest, they clustered together and held a
council of war.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h5><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a></h5>

<h4>THE SOUBAHDAR SUFDER JUNG</h4>


<p>'And where are our friends?' said the General,
when they had ridden for some considerable
distance, leaving, in the meanwhile, the wood in
which his men were stationed, and entering
another of wider extent. 'I thought you said
it was within a stone's throw.'</p>

<p>'We are close upon them now,' said the
Soubahdar. He gave a low whistle, and instantly
the ground seemed to tremble and there was
a rumbling as of thunder beneath their feet.</p>

<p>In the next instant a native officer, of a
lower grade than Sufder Jung, but as well
known to the General, appeared, and saluted.</p>

<p>'What is the meaning of this jack-in-the-box
business?' said the General, frowning.</p>

<p>'We are in hiding from our mutinous brethren,'
said Sufder Jung abjectly.</p>

<p>'Then there are only a few of you?'</p>

<p>'Nay, your Excellency, there are a hundred
good men under this wood, all waiting for a
word of encouragement from their General.'</p>

<p>'They would have understood their duty
better if they had remained in their lines till
they were ordered out on duty,' said the
General. 'Where is your captain?'</p>

<p>'Alas! your Excellency, our captain Sahib
is dead. He was one of the first to be struck
down.'</p>

<p>'By his own men?'</p>

<p>'By his own men, Excellency.'</p>

<p>In the meantime the men were coming up
one by one from the cave where they had
hidden themselves. They were the veterans of
the regiment, and the General knew them all;
as in the dim light of the wood they fell into
their ranks, he called one and another by their
names.</p>

<p>'I did not think to see <i>you</i> hiding in caves
and holes of the earth, my ancients,' he said.
And a voice from the ranks muttered, 'The
General Sahib will see stranger things than
these.'</p>

<p>'Who spoke?' said the old soldier, his hand
closing on his revolver.</p>

<p>'Silence!' thundered Sufder Jung; then to
the General with the deepest humility, 'Forgive
them, Excellency; they have been waiting, in
hunger and darkness for your Presence, and
some of them are impatient.'</p>

<p>'But what are they doing now? Do you
see, Sufder Jung, the line is wavering. By heaven
they want to surround us! Back, you hounds,
back!' shouted the General. 'Is discipline at
an end, or have you forgotten to stand at attention?
Halt, I say, this instant, and ground
your muskets, or by the beard of your Prophet,
the life of some of you will be short!'</p>

<p>As he spoke, his revolver was raised and
pointed at the men, and they, being awed by his
presence and manner, and none of them wishing
probably to be the first to bite the dust, obeyed
him sullenly. Scarcely had they done so before
the General's horse, which was an old campaigner,
and accustomed to stand like a rock,
gave a sudden plunge. With the shock the
revolver went off, lodging its contents in a tree.
Then Sufder Jung seized the rein of the horse,
which was snorting with pain and fear, and
immediately the silence that had followed the
General's stern command was exchanged for
the fiercest excitement. Uttering yells of hatred
and defiance, the men in the ranks swung round,
closing in as they moved, so as to make a circle
about the two men and the horse. In a
moment the General saw what they were about,
saw that he was alone in the midst of enemies,
but he lost neither his spirit nor his presence
of mind. Quick as thought, he faced round to
where the line was weakest, encountering, as he
did so, the ashen countenance of Sufder Jung.
'If you are not the son of a traitor,' he roared,
'open a way for me!'</p>

<p>He had dropped his revolver, which was
useless to him now, and had drawn his sword.</p>

<p>'My General,' moaned the wretched man,
'it is useless. Let his Excellency wait to hear
what his children will say to him.'</p>

<p>'You are false!' said the General, and with a
lunge which sent his sword through the Soubahdar's
arm, provoking a yell that echoed through
the wood, he set spurs to his horse.</p>

<p>The poor beast, which had been wounded
already, was wild with terror and pain. It gave
a mad plunge right into the living wall that was
forming in front of it. The General sat as if he
and his horse were one. His face never moved
from its stern composure. To some of the guilty
and unhappy men in the ranks his eyes were as
the eyes of an avenging deity. As, like a whirlwind,
he plunged on, his naked sword swinging
through the air, there came from one or two a
cry of 'We repent! Come back to us.'</p>

<p>But while those in the front were wavering,
those in the rear and not under the immediate
spell of his presence, were plucking up heart.</p>

<p>One of them sprang forward and levelled
his musket. A bullet whizzed through the air,
the General's horse gave one bound and fell,
and he, having been prepared for some such
treachery as this, sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>What was he to do? To attempt to fly on
foot would be useless, and result in such humiliation
as he did not intend to encounter. There
was nothing for it but to stand his ground.</p>

<p>Quietly he turned and faced the men. The
high soul of him had risen to meet the danger
that threatened him. Death it might be, but he
would meet death, as he had met life, a soldier&mdash;a
man in possession of himself.</p>

<p>'Now then,' he said to the men, who were
rushing up to seize him, 'what is it that you
want with me? Speak at once!'</p>

<p>Not a voice answered, and one or two of
the foremost slunk back.</p>

<p>'Do you want your precious leader, Sufder
Jung, to speak for you?' said the General. 'He
has spoken to good effect already. Wounded,
is he? Then let him be brought before me and
we will confer together.'</p>

<p>No one spoke, but there was an ominous
sound of clanking arms.</p>

<p>'Perhaps you would prefer to kill me at once,'
suggested the General ironically. 'There is
nothing to prevent you. I ought to know how
excellent your aim is. You have won many a
prize from me for your efficiency. It never occurred
to me then that I should one day be your
target. I am angry with myself, my men, that
I did not know you better.'</p>

<p>'You did know us,' sobbed one or two.</p>

<p>'What?' said the General, 'are some of you
faithful still!' A party of about twenty men&mdash;privates
all of them, rushed across the space
that separated the General from the mutineers
and ranged themselves on his side. 'Welcome!'
said the old man, in a strong hearty voice.
Then two or three came up, dragging Sufder
Jung between them. 'So!' said the General,
'this is the spokesman of the loyal troops.
Quick, Soubahdar! What do you and these
want of me?'</p>

<p>'Will his Excellency pardon me?' whined
the wretched creature, who was faint with loss
of blood; 'I am the instrument of others. For
myself&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Do I want to hear about yourself, hound?
You are a traitor. That is enough. What do
the rascals yonder want?'</p>

<p>'They want the promise of your Highness
to stop the troops marching from Meerut to-morrow.'</p>

<p>'And if I give this promise?'</p>

<p>'Your Excellency will be conducted back
safely to his guard.'</p>

<p>'And if I do not, you will shoot me?'</p>

<p>'His Highness knows that there is no dependence
to be placed upon these men. They
might do worse.'</p>

<p>'Well said, Sufder Jung! You are an admirable
spokesman,' said the General. 'And now
listen to me! You deserve death, and it is in my
heart to kill you as you stand there. But, as
you are in some sort an envoy, I will let you
live out the miserable remnant of your days.
Vengeance will overtake you. Mark my words,
and call them to mind when your hour comes!
You and the miserable creatures who have sent
you will suffer the penalty of your deeds. I
suffer for having trusted you, for I can have
little doubt now that, instead of saving my
family&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'No&mdash;no, by my master's head, by the
beard of the Prophet!' cried Sufder Jung.
'What I have told my lord is true. We
guarded his house, and it was only when we
had put the women of his Honour's family in
safety that we left the city.'</p>

<p>'If you speak truly, your folly is all the
greater. I would have rewarded you. I would
have treated you as friends. But that is over
now. Go back and tell the rascals out yonder
that I refuse their conditions. Yes,' said the
General, 'and tell them further that I will hold
no parley with rebels. Let them kill me if they
can. I defy them!'</p>

<p>The loyal twenty closed round him. It was
time, for the ring of bullets began to echo
through the woods. One or two were wounded.
The General had them picked up by their comrades,
as they moved back slowly with their
faces to the foe. 'See what it is to be a
traitor!' he said to the man nearest to him.
'The villains are shooting wild. If they had
shot so under <i>me</i>, there are a few of them who
wouldn't have survived to see this day. Come
on, you hounds! Come on, if you dare!'</p>

<p>The foremost of the dark mass, almost indistinguishable
in the gloom of the evening, were
so near that they could have touched him; but
they did not. Muttering curses of baffled rage,
they fell back confusedly, and their comrades
received them with yells of derision. 'Seize
him yourselves!' they said sullenly. 'The gods
fight for him. He has a charmed life.'</p>

<p>The little band, meanwhile, with the General
in the midst of them, were nearing the outskirts
of the wood. They had increased the distance
between them and their assailants, who, in the
gathering gloom, could scarcely catch more
than the outline of their figures. 'Fools!'
cried one of them&mdash;the man who had killed the
General's horse&mdash;'you are letting him escape.'
He was known as the most deadly shot in the
regiment, and he had eyes like a cat's. Over
and over again the General had boasted of his
powers.</p>

<p>This man took aim deliberately, the scarlet
coat serving him as a guide. Almost by a
miracle the General escaped; but the nearest
of his escort fell. 'That was Koolraj Sing, I
know,' rang out the voice of the indomitable
old man. 'Well aimed! Another like that,
my man, and&mdash;Ha! You villain&mdash;would you?
Others can see in the dark as well as you.
Have at him, Kullum Khan! Steadily, my
friend! Aim low! There is the moon, thank
heaven! Now! Halt and fire!'</p>

<p>Ping! Ping! Sharply and clearly the detonations
rang out. The smoke cleared away.
The General still stood his ground, but Koolraj
Sing, the dead shot of the regiment, the man
whose eyes could pierce through a stone wall,
was writhing in the agonies of death.</p>

<p>'Well done, Kullum Khan! said the General.
'You shall have a medal for this! Keep
together, my little ones! We shall be out of
this soon.'</p>

<p>'They are coming up behind,' said Kullum
Khan. 'Listen, Excellency!'</p>

<p>For a moment the General halted. Kullum
Khan had spoken truly. Close in their rear
they could hear sounds, the crackling of the dry
branches of the underwood, and the heavy
breathing of men and animals. 'Who's there?'
cried the General in English. He was answered
with an English cheer. 'Courage, my men!'
he cried joyfully to the little band of the faithful,
'and keep close to me, lest they mistake you
for the rebels. Hurry up, my hearties!' to his own
men, who, having missed him and feeling certain
that treachery was on foot, were searching the
wood. 'These,' pointing to his escort, as one
and another of his troopers rode up, 'are comrades.
I owe my life to them. They have
stood by me gallantly. Your horse, Tommy,' to
his own servant, who was first to come up.
'Never fear, you shall have your hand in the
fun. Now then, are we all ready? You see those
black-hearted scoundrels out yonder. Three
times our number, boys, but cowards every
mother's son of them. Charge for old England's
sake, and mow them down!'</p>

<p>A ringing cheer, clear and joyful, which
echoed and re-echoed through the wood, that
seemed peopled by hundreds instead of tens,
greeted these gallant words. The mutineers
answered it with a scream of defiance. Then,
crash, crash, thundering over the dry underwood,
came the tramp of the English horsemen.
The Pandies, who were on foot, stood their
ground, firing wildly. Several horses fell, and
their riders joined the faithful Indians, who
were coming up behind them at a quick march.</p>

<p>'Force them into the open,' cried the General.
'See&mdash;where the light shines in!'</p>

<p>At his word the little band of horsemen
swung round to the left. The mutineers, expecting
a front attack, were taken by surprise,
and, instead of facing round, as the only surviving
officer commanded them, they broke
into confused groups, some of which stood their
ground, while by far the greater number took
to their heels. Uttering a cry of despair and
hatred, the officer drew his tulwar across his
throat and fell at the very feet of the General's horse,
which started and plunged aside. At the same
moment a mutineer, who had been lying in ambush
close by, sprang forward and discharged
his musket at the General. The gallant old
man's bridle arm fell helpless by his side; but
he gathered up his reins in his right hand and
pressed on. As for the men, English and Indians,
they had eyes and ears for nothing but the foe.
Stumbling and plunging, now in close order, and
now separately, they rode and ran over the
broken ground. Meanwhile, with the fatality
that comes of abject dread, the mutineers were
rushing towards the open.</p>

<p>Night had fallen, but the moon, which rose
early at this season, was flooding all the plain
with silver light, and when the Englishmen
emerged from the wood they saw the fugitives&mdash;grey
figures in the ghostly light&mdash;only a short
distance in front of them. 'Halt!' cried the
General, 'and fire!'</p>

<p>They obeyed with alacrity. Every shot took
effect. Some who had not been touched fell
prone with fright and weariness, and over the
plain the bodies of dead and dying lay scattered.</p>

<p>'Quick march!' cried the General.</p>

<p>It was like the loosing of an arrow from
a bow. In skirmishing order, but keeping well
in line, they cantered madly across the plain.
Passionate wrath and the wild thirst for vengeance
made demons of them all. There was
no quarter given. The black-hearted wretches
they were pursuing had laid a net for the
feet of their open-hearted General, and had
nearly succeeded in entrapping him. For their
treachery they should die. Group after group
was overtaken. Some were speared, some were
shot. Not one of them all turned to bay, or lifted
up his hand against the avengers. For, lying
heavy as lead at the heart of each one and
making him a coward, was the consciousness
that he had played the part of traitor.</p>

<p>A short half-hour, and it was all over. Some
few, who were the first to fly, and were particularly
fleet of foot, escaped into the country. The
others lay dead on the plain outside Meerut.
One of them only, Soubahdar Sufder Jung, who
had been wounded, but not mortally, remained
behind in the wood. All that night and the
following day he kept in hiding. Then, having
stripped off his uniform, and clothed himself
in the garments of a peasant, whom he slew in
the fields, he took to the road.</p>

<p>Their work done, the English soldiers halted,
and discovering that the General, who up to
the moment when they emerged from the wood
had been foremost in the advance, was not with
them, they rode back to seek him. Loss of
blood from his wound, with the exhaustion
which followed hard upon his excitement, had
been too much for the old man, who, for the
first time in all his life, had swooned away.
Fortunately his English servant was by his side.
He saw him reel in his saddle and caught
him in his arms. By this time, however, the
General's senses had returned. When his men
rode back for him, he was sitting on the ground
under a tree, Kullum Khan supporting him on
one side, and his soldier-servant on the other.</p>

<h4>WITHIN THE WALLS OF MEERUT</h4>


<p>Within the walls of Meerut, meanwhile, all was
confusion and despair. Those of the English
and Eurasian residents who had escaped from
the massacre of the 10th of May were gathered
together, in much closer quarters than they had
ever occupied before, tremulously expecting the
worst. The British soldiers, burning to be led
against the mutineers, were kept day and night
upon guard, for the rebels' return with reinforcements,
to finish the deadly work they had begun,
was hourly expected; but they did not come,
and at last it dawned upon the minds of those
in authority that, seeing they were within entrenchments,
a smaller number of soldiers might
serve to guard them. It took some time for
this idea to work in the official mind; but, at
last, to the intense satisfaction of the soldiers
and regimental officers, five hundred men were
told off to join the English force which was
supposed to be marching on Delhi.</p>

<p>It was on the 23rd that the General encountered
the detachment from his mutinous
regiment in the wood; and, early on the
24th, the force from Meerut was to be in
readiness to march. Hence the ambush. The
rebels, whose intelligence department was much
better managed than ours&mdash;they had spies everywhere&mdash;knowing
exactly what was going to happen,
had imagined that, through the General,
whom, they believed, they could easily entrap,
they might paralyse the action of the English,
so far, at least, as to delay, for some days, the
march of a detachment from Meerut.</p>

<p>They had, as we have seen, most grossly
miscalculated. But, meanwhile, the firing had
been heard at Meerut, and a gallant young
officer, well known to the General, who had been
burning to distinguish himself and to redeem the
honour of the English arms, gained permission
to go out and reconnoitre with a party of fifty
horsemen.</p>

<p>It was late in the evening; but the moon
was well up, and there was light enough to
guide them to the scene of the little skirmish.
It was over by the time they rode out upon the
plain. The General and his men had taken their
own vengeance; but, exhausted as they were,
their chief wounded, their horses dead-beat, and
their situation precarious&mdash;since, for all they
knew to the contrary, the woods behind them
might be full of rebels&mdash;the sight of this little
band of their countrymen coming out to meet
them was, beyond expression, cheering.</p>

<p>'They are not all dead then, thank God!'
said the General. 'Two of you gallop out to
meet them, boys, and tell them how it is with
us.'</p>

<p>'Can you sit a horse, sir,' said Tommy, 'or
shall we send for a litter?'</p>

<p>'Litter! Nonsense! I'm not going to give
up the ghost yet,' said the old soldier, testily.
'But,' to himself, 'I shan't mind being at home.
I believe the scoundrel spoke the truth so far.
Poor little monkeys! I wonder which of them
is hurt. Oh, God, if I had only listened to
reason, and left them all at home!'</p>

<p>'Do you want anything, sir?' said one of
his men, who saw him speaking, but could not
catch his voice.</p>

<p>'No, thank you,' he answered, 'except to
get away from this. Ah! here they are!
Friends this time, not foes! Welcome, Bertie,'
to the young officer, who had sprung from his
horse, and was looking down upon him
mournfully. 'Don't look so glum, you young rascal.
They are safe?' sharply.</p>

<p>'Your people escaped, General. One of the
young ladies was hurt, not seriously, I believe.
Lady Elton has been in the most terrible state
of anxiety.'</p>

<p>'No doubt! No doubt! Well, I shall hear
all about it from themselves soon. Lift me into
a saddle, Bertie. We'd better be moving.'</p>

<p>Kullum Khan, who was sobbing like a child,
took the General under one arm, the young
officer under the other, and in a few moments
they had him mounted on the quietest and
strongest of the horses, a trooper getting up
behind him, to keep him in his place. Then,
carrying the wounded Indians between them,
the cavalcade set off across the plain.</p>

<p>The mango grove where the skirmish had
begun was within three miles of Meerut; but
as, for the sake of the wounded, they were
obliged to move slowly, the transit took some
time. Scouts, meanwhile, were thrown out in
every direction, to keep the coasts clear, and
warn them of danger. But there was not even
an alarm. The combatants, as the General said
grimly, were on their faces, and the non-combatants
kept out of their way.</p>

<p>They came upon the outskirts of Meerut.
The General was moaning heavily, with pain
and anguish. There was nothing now to keep
up his proud heart, and it fell.</p>

<p>He knew all the landmarks, and each one
had some memory for him. There was the
little grove where, one glorious evening, he
and his men had picnicked when they came
down upon Meerut from the Sikh war, to
enjoy a little rest after the hardships of the
campaign. How splendid they had looked, and
how handy and helpful they were, living on
next to nothing, and going through fatigue
and privation that would have floored half a
European regiment!</p>

<p>And now they were close on the cantonments.
He had built several of the bungalows
here and laid out their gardens&mdash;the mess-house
for the officers of his regiment, the colonel's
house, the spacious and beautiful bungalow,
finished while he was in England, to which only
a few weeks before he had brought his wife and
children. This last was outside cantonments
and nearer to the native lines than any other
English house.</p>

<p>He remembered now, pacing slowly and
sadly over the blackened ground, with the
charred ruins of what had so lately been a happy
home staring him in the face, how one or two
had warned him that, in case of a rising, the
situation would be dangerous, and how proudly
he had smiled at the absurdity of the notion.
'While my family and I are in the station,' he
said, 'a rising would be impossible, and I don't
ask anyone else to occupy the house.' And now
it was literally gutted.</p>

<p>As they were crossing what had been the
garden of the General's bungalow, an old man
came out from the ruins and confronted them.
The young officer who, with drawn sword, was
leading the cavalcade, would have swept him
aside, but he cried out so piteously to be heard
that the General, who was some yards behind,
ordered that he should be brought to him.</p>

<p>'I think I know your voice,' he said.</p>

<p>'The Sahib should know,' replied the man,
weeping bitterly; 'for I have served him these
twenty years.'</p>

<p>'You are Yaseen Khan, my bearer.'</p>

<p>'I am Yaseen Khan, Sahib General, and my
son Kullum&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I am here, Yaseen,' said the Sepoy from
behind. 'I could not go on, and I slew Koolraj
Sing, who tried to deceive me.'</p>

<p>'The gods be praised!' murmured the old
man. 'Sahib, by the God you worship, I beseech
you to take me on with you!'</p>

<p>'Why are you here, Yaseen Khan?' said the
General.</p>

<p>'Have patience, Excellency, and I will tell
you everything. They surrounded this house
and set it on fire in three places. Then I ran to
the lines and called my son, Kullum, who, with
Soubahdar Sufder Jung and others, came up,
and the <i>budmashes</i> fled. Trixy Sahib was hurt;
I know not how. They carried her in their
arms&mdash;my son Kullum and the Soubahdar&mdash;as
if she had been their own child. The others
walked, for no carriage was to be found; but
the men guarded them carefully, and not a hair
of their heads was touched. I thought of the
General Sahib's gold, and I went back to get it.
I could not carry it away; but I buried it in a
secret place. Then the <i>budmashes</i> came round
the house again, yelling like evil spirits. They
found me, and said they would kill me if I did
not find them gold. I said I would find it, and,
in going, I escaped. I was close to them, Sahib,
and I heard their cries. They would have torn
me to pieces if they had found me; but there
was an alarm. Some one said, "The Sahibs are
coming!" and they ran out, and I saw and
heard them no more. But I dared not move;
I kept in hiding, waiting for your Honour's
return, and living on the food I could pick up.
For two days I have not eaten. Have pity on
me, Sahib, and take me on!'</p>

<p>'Mount him on one of the horses, and bring
him on behind me,' said the General. 'I believe
that what he tells me is the truth.'</p>

<p>A few moments later they came upon the
vedettes, and then, the young officer having
answered the challenge, they entered the town.</p>

<p>Here the General insisted upon dismounting.</p>

<p>'I can't present myself to my wife and children
in this guise,' he said. 'Dismiss your men to
their quarters, Bertie, and let them find quarters
for my men, and for the natives who were
faithful. You give me your arm and we will
find Lady Elton.'</p>

<p>The officer gave the necessary directions,
adding, on his own account, that the surgeon of
his regiment should be sent to the General's
quarters, and they set off together, the General
leaning heavily on the arm of his guide, and
Yaseen Khan, the bearer, following them.</p>

<p>Lady Elton and her children were under
canvas. They had preferred this arrangement
to accepting shelter from any of the houses
thrown open to them, and the Soubahdar and
his men having succeeded in saving many of
their things, they had been able already to give
their new quarters a tolerably home-like appearance.
It was only in this way&mdash;in exerting
themselves to set things straight 'for father,'
who, they felt sure, must come in soon&mdash;that
the girls could keep their mother cheerful, or
that any of them could chase away the terrible
despondency and shuddering fear which would,
at times, take possession of them. For upon
these unfortunate ladies, bred up in the traditions
of the old Anglo-Indian, who looked upon
a native as a cross between a machine and an
animal&mdash;a creature to be treated with kindly
contempt when he behaved himself, and to be
promptly licked into shape when he did not&mdash;the
mutiny fell like a bolt of fire out of a clear
sky. They had heard rumours of discontent,
but nothing came of them. They were disposed
to think that the repressive measures had not
been sufficiently severe, and when on May 9 the
mutineers of the 3rd Native Cavalry, who had
been condemned by their own countrymen, and
sentenced to ten years' imprisonment, were
stripped of their uniform and put in irons,
while sorry for the unhappy men who had been
so miserably deluded, they believed that this
one severe example would be sufficient, and that
no more would be heard of mutiny. Lady Elton
was fond of quoting her husband in those days.
'The General says all they want is firmness.
They are the best fellows in the world when you
take them the right way. He ought to know,
for he has had so much experience.' And then
Maud would repeat her saucy little phrase about
the riding-whip, and the ladies, who had come
to consult them, would go away reassured.
'You may depend upon it,' they would say,
'General Elton and his wife know more about
these people than we do.'</p>

<p>To be awakened from this dream of security
by the rattle of musketry from the lines; and,
after a few minutes of terror-stricken silence,
the tramp of armed men upon the plain, and the
shock of contending forces, was terrible beyond
description. How, stirred up by Yaseen Khan,
who ran in hot haste for his son, they barricaded
themselves into the innermost room of the bungalow,
piling furniture against the doors to keep
out the mutineers; how, sitting huddled together,
clasped in one another's arms, they heard the
defiant shouts and yells of rage come nearer and
nearer; how Trixy, the first to recover presence
of mind, climbed up to a peep-hole under the
roof, and came back with the awful intelligence
that the stables and kitchens were in flames;
how they heard the wretches, who were mad
with bhang and fanaticism, getting on to the
roof; then the yell, when the thatch was torn
aside, and one of the fierce creatures looked
down on them; the screams of the girls, and
brave little Trixy's pistol-shot, followed by a
shriek from the first scoundrel, and a shot from
the man behind him, which brought the poor
girl to the ground,&mdash;all this lives still in these
poor women's remembrance as a dream of
horror!</p>

<p>They were rescued as we have seen. Those
surrounding the General's house were <i>budmashes</i>
from the bazaars and the criminals who had
rushed out when the gaol doors were opened,
and at the approach of the disciplined force
under Soubahdar Sufder Jung every one of them
took to their heels. The ladies, half dead with
fright, and some of their choicest possessions,
were escorted safely to the English barracks,
where they lodged that night. Then began that
weary waiting-time, which to poor Lady Elton
was even worse than the scene of horror through
which they had passed. Her husband was
away. She had not heard from him for some
days, and did not know where he was. Her
beloved eldest daughter Grace and her niece,
only lately married, were in the heart of a district
said to be unsettled before, and which now,
when this terrible news from Meerut went
abroad, would be almost certain to rise. She
had friends at Cawnpore, friends at Delhi, friends
at Jhansi. None of them all were so well
guarded as they of Meerut. If massacre and
destruction could run riot here, what would it
be there?</p>

<p>Day by day she looked for her husband's
arrival. She never feared for his personal
safety. She had still the firmest belief in his
power over the native soldiery; but if he came
something might be done. For this made one
element in the misery of the old soldier's wife
and daughters. Nothing was being done. 'If
I were in command here,' Trixy would say,
clenching her little fists, 'not one of those brutes
should have reached Delhi. Bertie Liston says
the men were burning to be off. He could
scarcely keep them quiet. I think I should have
let them go&mdash;gone with them.'</p>

<p>'Trixy is a great warrior since she fired that
pistol,' said Maud; 'but, seriously, mother, don't
you think something ought to be done?'</p>

<p>'My dear children, be patient! We are
women. We know nothing. Soldiers must obey
orders,' said Lady Elton sadly. 'If your father
would only come!'</p>

<p>'He will come soon, mother darling, don't be
afraid,' said gentle little Lucy.</p>

<p>Some such conversation as this had taken
place on the afternoon of the day when firing
was heard outside the walls. The five women
heard it distinctly as they sat over their tea in
the tent. Then Bertie Liston came rushing in
with a radiant face. 'Good-bye,' he said, 'I am
sent out to reconnoitre. What will you give me
if I bring you back the General?'</p>

<p>'Anything, everything&mdash;all we have,' cried
Trixy impulsively. She was lying on a charpoy,
for she had not yet recovered from her wound.
Bertie looked at her, and her pale face flushed;
but there was time for no more words. He
went out: she heard his horse's hoofs clattering
over the paving-stones in the compound of the
barracks, and covering her face with her hands
she burst into tears.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An hour or more passed by. The firing
outside had ceased. Nothing could be heard
but the pacing of the sentinels and the
chowkedars crying out one to the other. Darkness
had fallen; but the little company in the
tent did not stir. Then Maud, crying out that
she could stand it no longer, lighted a lamp;
Trixy, who was very much ashamed of her little
outburst, asked for a book, and Lady Elton fell
back upon her never-failing resource&mdash;the silk
stockings she was knitting for the General. 'Do
you think, dears,' she said to the two youngest
girls, Lucy and Mildred, 'that you could sing
one of your duets? If father did come home
to-night, it would please him to hear your
voices.' They said they would try, and in a few
moments their sweet clear young voices rose
above the stillness. It was one of the sentimental
ditties that we used to admire in those
days, neither the words of the song nor the
music to which it was set of a particularly high
order; but as, supported by his young friend, the
old General approached the lighted tent, and
heard in his girls' sweet voices of wild waves
whispering and red roses fading away, his heart
thrilled with a rapture such as no artistic music
could have given. 'Bless them,' he said, in a
low and heartfelt voice. 'All right, isn't it,
Bertie? They couldn't sing like that if the
shock had been too much for them. There!
what an old donkey I am! I knew the children
had the pluck of&mdash;Come on, Bertie. They are
stopping. They hear us. Back, Yaseen Khan,
you old fool! I don't want you to announce me.'</p>

<p>And now the curtain before the tent is
thrown aside, and he sees them&mdash;his sweet wife
and the children, who are dearer to him than
his life, and his stern eyes fill with tears, and the
voice of thunder, which only a few moments
before had roared out defiance to a hundred
foes, is as weak as that of a little child. 'Well,
here I am! How are you all?' he says, feebly.</p>

<p>He is in the gloom; they are in the light.
They have not seen, but they have heard. In a
moment they spring up, all but poor Trixy, who
is crying quietly, and there are cries of 'Wilfrid!
Thank God! Father! Father!' And a little
voice from the corner is heard to say, 'Bertie
has brought him. Don't let Bertie go away!'</p>

<p>All at once there is a lull. They have
drawn him under the light, and they see that
his face is pale and drawn, and one of them
discovers that his arm is roughly bandaged.
'Father has been wounded. Children, don't
press round him so,' cries Lady Elton. 'Will
some one run for a doctor?'</p>

<p>'The Doctor Sahib is here,' says a voice outside;
a quiet voice, which contrasts strangely
with the agitated tones of those within the tent.
In the next instant Yaseen Khan, the bearer,
clad in snow-white tunic and dhootie, and having
on his head a voluminous turban&mdash;how he had
set himself in order no one ever knew&mdash;steps
forward, and having, with his usual dignity,
saluted those in the tent, ushers in the doctor.</p>

<p>Then from that irrepressible little person in
the corner there comes a peal of laughter.
'Bravo, Yaseen Khan!' she cries. 'You are
decidedly master of the situation. Have you
been hiding yourself in a band-box all this time,
you most unconscionable old man?'</p>

<p>Yaseen Khan merely salaams and smiles. He
is busy attending to his master, and has no time
for banter.</p>

<h5><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a></h5>

<h4>THE RAJAH SURPRISED</h4>


<p>It was on that very night, the night of the
23rd of May, that Hoosanee returned to Gumilcund,
after his unsuccessful effort to save Grace
Elton and her cousin. He reported himself to
his master at once, and gave an account of what
he had done. It was his opinion that the rising at
Nowgong would be speedy and cruel. Many of
the Sahibs, he said, were disliked by the people
and soldiers, and would not be spared. He did
not venture to repeat his conversation with the
chuprassie; but he said that he believed there was
one servant in the Captain Sahib's service who
might be trusted. 'The lotus-eyed,' he averred,
must be saved at all hazards, and he offered,
should his master desire it, to go to the station
again, and to linger about in disguise, watching
over her, until the danger was over, or the rising
had come. In case of a rising, he would provide
for some temporary refuge in the neighbourhood,
whence, if they could not escape in any other
way, his master would fetch them at the point of
the sword.</p>

<p>Tom agreed to the proposal, suggesting only
that he should go in place of Hoosanee; or, if
that were impossible, that they should go together.
But both his servant and Chunder
Singh, who was present, pointed out to him so
clearly that his presence, instead of helping,
might spoil everything, that he was obliged to
give way. Hoosanee should have the honour and
joy of watching over the sweetest woman on all
the earth; Chunder Singh should hold himself in
readiness to obey the first summons to arms, and
Tom had spies posted in the different villages on
the route between Nowgong and Gumilcund, so
that Hoosanee's messages might be passed on
from one to another, and that help could reach
him speedily.</p>

<p>He was himself meditating a dangerous enterprise,
nothing less than marching into Jhansi
alone, presenting himself before the Ranee, and
persuading her, under promise of his personal
support, and his influence with the Government
in case of her failure&mdash;for he had now certain
knowledge that she intended soon to raise the
standard of revolt&mdash;to allow him to carry off to
Gumilcund the English women and children in
the station.</p>

<p>But many things had to be done before he
could start. June was nearly in when, riding
Snow-queen, and dressed as an Indian of rank,
he left Gumilcund. In despite of all Chunder
Singh urged to the contrary, he was unattended,
it being his belief that the Ranee would be more
likely to listen to him if he entered her palace
alone.</p>

<p>The hot season being well in, he travelled
principally at night, resting by day in a grove or
peasant's hut. He was treated with consideration
everywhere. Now and then a greybeard would
reprove him for travelling so heedlessly in these
unsettled times, and once or twice he was asked
his business. To this he would answer that he
was a kinsman of the Ranee of Jhansi, and that
she had sent for him; but that what her will
was he knew not. Everything, in fact, went
well, so that, but for the adventure I am about
to relate, he would have been in Jhansi before
the rising; and it is just possible that, by his
influence, the memory of a proud and not ungenerous
woman would have been saved from a
foul blot, and many innocent people delivered
from destruction.</p>

<p>He came to within a few miles of the borders
of Jhansi. For the last two days he had been
pressing his pace, for sinister rumours were
abroad, and he feared to be too late. But there
had been terrible rain, and the ways were miry,
and Snow-queen was hanging her head dejectedly.
For her sake rather than his own he
determined to rest for a few hours. There was
a village close by. He rode in slowly, and asked
for the house of the headman, where, after a
little parley, he was allowed to rest, while he
watched his horse being fed and watered.</p>

<p>He was on the little mud platform in front
of the house. Snow-queen was tethered close
by. It was mid-day and the place was silent as
the grave, so that presently, in spite of strenuous
efforts to hold his eyes open, he fell into a dog's
sleep. How long it lasted he could not tell.
He was aroused by the trampling of feet and
clamour of many voices. He sprang up, and,
almost at the same moment, the headman came
to him, with a strange look in his eyes.</p>

<p>'You must go on,' he said, 'the Ranee is
here.'</p>

<p>'Ranee&mdash;what ranee&mdash;of Jhansi?' he asked.</p>

<p>'I know not,' the man answered; 'but we
want this place.'</p>

<p>'And you shall have it. I am ready to go
on,' answered Tom. 'First let me pay you for
your trouble.'</p>

<p>The man took the money hurriedly, and
Tom turned aside to where he had left Snow-queen,
and vaulted into the saddle. He had
scarcely done so before the foremost of the troop
of horsemen that were clattering through the
village came up with him and seized his bridle-rein.</p>

<p>'What do you want with me?' said Tom,
trying to free himself.</p>

<p>In a trice two or three more rode up, and he
found himself surrounded.</p>

<p>'Now, then,' he cried out, angrily. 'What
is the meaning of this?'</p>

<p>'Our lady, the Ranee, would have speech
with you, sir stranger,' said the first of the
troop.</p>

<p>'Where is she; and what does she mean by
stopping a peaceful traveller?'</p>

<p>'You are alone. She has armed men at her
back,' said the horseman cynically. 'But she
means you no hurt. You had better come
quietly.'</p>

<p>'Loose my bridle-rein, then,' cried the young
rajah. 'And you,' to the two or three ragged-looking
figures that were crowding about him,
'fall back!'</p>

<p>They obeyed and he went forward slowly,
with all the dignity he could command. Had
he seen any chance of escape, he would have
given a touch to Snow-queen, and in a few
moments she would have shown them a clean
pair of heels. But he was not in open ground;
he was in the long straggling street of the
village, with horsemen in front of him and
horsemen behind, and there was no possibility
of getting away. Wit, he felt, must serve him
for strength, and if, as these men had said, their
leader was really a woman, he did not doubt
that he would be able so far to humour her as
to be allowed to proceed.</p>

<p>Presently he lifted up his eyes and saw her.
She was in the midst of the cavalcade, borne in
an open palanquin, and covered from head to
foot in a saree of black gauze richly spangled
with gold.</p>

<p>As he approached, the men-at-arms who
accompanied her separating to right and left to
let him pass, she ordered her bearers to stop.
Tom drew up in front of her and made a low
salute. He could not discern the features of
the lady's face; but he saw enough to make
him sure that she was not the Ranee of Jhansi.
A few seconds passed. He would not speak
until she addressed him; he sat with head
bowed humbly, after the Oriental fashion, while
the piercing eyes behind the black and gold
saree looked him through and through.</p>

<p>Then came a curious and unexpected shock.
She was speaking. He thought, at least, that
she was speaking; but he could not be quite
sure that his senses had not deceived him. For
this high, clear voice, winged, to his fancy, with
mockery, was not, certainly, the voice of one of
the daughters of the land. Yet the language
was the supple Urdu that the educated natives
use.</p>

<p>'Who are you, sir stranger? And what
brings you to our dominions?' she said.</p>

<p>He gave an involuntary start, then answered,
bowing low, 'Were it not that the whole world
is under the dominion of beauty, I might ask
my gracious lady her right to stop the traveller
on his journey. As it is, I bow to her will. I
am a kinsman of the Ranee of Jhansi, and I go
in hot haste to confer with her on the strange
portents of the time.'</p>

<p>From behind the saree came a sound like
the repressed gurgle of laughter; but it was
stopped instantly, and the high, disdainful voice
went on. 'I believe that you are lying, sir
stranger; but the truth of your saying shall be
proved. We, too, propose to visit our sister of
Jhansi. Remain you with our escort, and we
will take you in with us. If you are really
what you profess to be, the delay will be of no
account to you, and you may save your skin.'</p>

<p>'My skin is not of so much account to me
that, for its sake, I should neglect my duty.
The business on which I have come is urgent,
and I cannot delay. Will your Highness permit
me to take my leave?'</p>

<p>There was another suppressed gurgle. He
could have sworn, moreover, that from under
the black and gold gauze there came a little
English 'No'; but in the next moment he
thought that his fancy must have been playing
tricks with him, for the veiled lady was speaking
in stern, slow accents.</p>

<p>'I will not permit you to leave us. Fall
back, and take your place amongst my men.'</p>

<p>'Your Highness&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Silence! I have listened to you long
enough. Abdul, seize his bridle-rein. If he
resists, dismount him, and bring him on foot.'</p>

<p>Seeing that there was, for the moment, no
possibility of successful resistance, Tom fell
back amongst the escort, who, so long as he
walked on with them quietly, did not seem disposed
to show him any violence.</p>

<p>The headman of the village came out, meanwhile,
to meet them, bringing provisions, and
laying himself and all he possessed at the feet of
the Ranee. She accepted his homage, but did
not deign to speak to him, and, after halting for
a few moments, she ordered her bearers and
escort to proceed.</p>

<p>Tom had been longing to leave the village,
for he thought that, on the open ground, he
might easily escape; but he found himself so
closely watched, that no such effort was practicable.
Reluctantly he made up his mind to wait
until the night.</p>

<p>He had gone over this ground before, making
himself well acquainted with the bearings of
the country, and when, soon after leaving the
village, the leaders of the cavalcade swung
round to the left, he knew perfectly well that
they were going away from Jhansi, and not
towards it. This he said to Abdul, but he was
vouchsafed no answer. Tired and irritated,
wondering what was to be the end of this
strange adventure, and blaming himself bitterly
for having halted when he was almost within a
stone's throw of his goal, he went on the way
he was led.</p>

<p>It was afternoon when the veiled lady met
him, and they tramped on until nightfall.</p>

<p>By this time, so far as Tom, who had begun
to lose his bearings, could judge, they were
many miles distant from Jhansi. They encamped
in open ground, there being no village
or grove of trees at hand. A tent was pitched
for the lady, who had been travelling for some
time with the curtains of her palanquin closed.
Tom, who felt that she was dealing treacherously
with him, and who was haunted, moreover, by
a bewildering suspicion that she was something
very different from what she gave herself out to
be, made an effort, when the cavalcade halted,
to spring forward from his place in the rear,
that he might speak to her, or at least catch a
glimpse of her figure; but the fierce and burly
Abdul placed himself in front of him. The
vigilance of this man had never for one moment
faltered, and it was evident to Tom that he was
keeping up the other men to their duty of
watchfulness.</p>

<p>Thinking it well to appear submissive, he
dismounted with the rest of the horsemen,
tethered and fed Snow-queen, and joined one of
the groups that were assembled round the little
fires that had been lighted to cook the men's
evening meal. A place was made for him, and
he was given a supper of chupatties and dal,
which, as he was simulating the manners of a
person of high rank, he received in his own
bowl, retiring a few yards distant from his
attendants to eat it.</p>

<p>Then he returned to the spot where he had
left Snow-queen, wrapped himself up in his
chuddah, and, with his back propped against
the tree to which she was tethered, fell into a
deep sleep.</p>

<p>Tom was one of those favoured mortals who
have the gift of sleep. No matter how anxious
and harassed he might have been in the daytime,
night always brought him peace and refreshment.
Afterwards he thought of it as a
strange thing. Here he was alone in the midst
of strangers. What they wanted with him he
did not know; but he knew full well that he
had upon his person what, if they discovered it,
would tempt their cupidity past any reasonable
limit of endurance; he knew also that he had a
great stake to fight for, and a hard problem to
solve, and yet he slept&mdash;slept as peacefully as if
he had been in his own little room in the cottage
that looked down upon the silver Thames.</p>

<p>Two hours passed away. His attendants
had looked at him several times, and, at last,
being satisfied of his perfect unconsciousness,
they had followed his example, and now no one
but Abdul was awake.</p>

<p>Abdul had received his orders. He was to
watch over the prisoner, but not to molest him
in any way; he knew very well that, if he were
detected in any attempt at outrage or robbery,
he would pay the forfeit of his life for the crime;
but the stillness of the moment and the perfect
unconsciousness of the sleeping man were too
much for his prudence. He would not hurt
him. That would be to betray himself; but he
would cautiously feel about him to see if he had
valuables concealed in his sash or turban. If
he had not, no harm was done. If he had, and
if Abdul purloined them, then Abdul would be
so much the richer, and the high-born youth,
who would not venture, surrounded as he was
by hostile strangers, to make any ado about his
loss, would be the poorer. And that would be
all.</p>

<p>Thinking thus he crept closer to Tom, and,
having softly drawn his chuddah aside began
to finger his fine satin tunic. Once or twice
the sleeping youth stirred, and then the robber
drew back, but supposing himself in a dream,
he settled down again, and Abdul went on with
his work. The heart of the robber was jubilant
and his fingers were light, for he was sure now
that there was gold in the youth's waistband,
gold which would soon be transferred to his
own. The gold was almost within his grasp, he
heard its jingle, his long fingers swept it, as
they moved to and fro. Why then did he stop
suddenly and draw back? Had he seen the
youth's breast and shoulders white in the moonlight,
and did he recognise him as one of the
hated race, whom, in a few short weeks, the
children of the Prophet would scatter and slay?
But this should have given him courage, for he
knew very well that he had but to say that
a Feringhee spy had entered the camp, and
the youth whom he purposed to rob would
have his lips sealed effectually. Surely it was
something more that stayed Abdul's hand. And,
in that moment's pause, his prey escaped him.
Strong, and with all his wits about him, Tom
awoke; seeing his chuddah and tunic open, and
Abdul glaring at him, like a startled wild animal,
he sprang to his feet and struck out with the
dagger which he carried in his belt.</p>

<p>At the same moment the robber was smitten
from behind. As, with a muttered cry, he fell
to the ground, a voice broke upon the stillness
of the camp: 'So the White Ranee punishes
treachery. Let all take notice and beware!'</p>

<h4>THE SNAKE-CHARMER AND THE VEILED LADY</h4>


<p>As for Tom, he laid himself down again, not
to sleep this time, but to watch. There was,
however, no further alarm, nor, when, long
before dawn, the camp began to stir and the
morning fires were lighted, was any remark
made with regard to the incident of the night.
A narrow trench was dug; the robber was laid
in it, and, once more, the cavalcade moved forward.
Throughout that day they went on
steadily. The prisoner was continually on the
alert, but he was given no chance either of
escaping or of speaking to the veiled lady in
the litter. His passionate irritation over the
delay grew, meanwhile, to such a height, that
he was on the point once or twice of making
some mad effort that would have had the effect
of either seriously jeopardising his life or putting
fetters on his limbs. That he restrained
himself was due not so much to prudence as to
fatality. He could never find a moment when
his will-power and his surroundings leapt together.
When he might have acted he could
not. When all his nerves were braced and the
blood coursed like fire about his heart, something
would always happen to make action
impossible. So, with throbbing brain and a
heart as heavy as lead, he travelled on. Every
hour was taking them further away from Jhansi,
and nearer Gumilcund, although they were not
shaping their course directly for the last-named
city. The men were reticent before him, but
he gathered from a stray word here and there that
they were themselves uncertain about their movements,
which would depend upon the result of an
enterprise undertaken by some of their comrades.</p>

<p>Towards mid-day they halted, and a man,
who appeared to be a moulvie, or priest, joined
them, was admitted to the tent, and held a conference
with the lady, travelling on with the
cavalcade as far as the next village, where he
took his leave. What news he brought Tom did
not hear, but he judged from the jubilant faces
of the men, and the laughter and rude jests,
some of which made his blood curdle, that
there had been another triumph over the
Europeans, and that these men were expecting
to share in its results.</p>

<p>Evening came and they halted again. It
was in the neighbourhood of a large village, to
the right of which stretched a mere or shallow
pond, half covered with red pond-weed and overshadowed
with some fine acacia and fig trees.
By order of the lady in the litter, her tent,
which always formed the centre of the camp,
was pitched on the shores of the mere, being
separated from the village by its waters.</p>

<p>Immediately the men unsaddled, tethered and
fed their horses, and lighted their evening fires.
The villagers, meanwhile, who were hiding
behind every tree and angle of wall, having
satisfied themselves that those in camp had no
hostile intentions, poled themselves over the
mere in flat-bottomed boats, bringing with them
fruit and vegetables, and grain and milk, so that
presently the camp was like a fair.</p>

<p>Sitting by the mere, and listening absently
to the jabber and turmoil of the camp, where
buying and selling and wrangling and gossiping
were going briskly forward, Tom watched the
curious scene. He was trying to devise some
scheme either of escape or of making his
situation known to Chunder Singh, when, suddenly,
and in obedience to no act of volition of
his own, so at least it seemed to himself, the
current of his thought changed. It darted
upon him with the force of an electric current
that the scene upon which he was gazing was
not new. The livid sky behind the mud walls
of the village, the blood-red pavement at his
feet, the fierce dark faces about him, surely, in
some other life, he had seen them before. A
moment more, and he remembered. He was
living again over the strange night when all the
conditions of his life were changed; his feet
trod the banks of the stream that washed the
gardens of his tranquil home; the dawn, the
sweet dawn of an English June, was breaking,
and the trees that he knew and loved were
swaying to and fro over his head to the delicious
breeze of the morning. <i>Then</i> he had seen <i>this</i>!
It was his dream, his very dream; but not all!</p>

<p>The effect upon his mind was overpowering.
His strength, and the presence of mind, upon
which he had always relied, seemed to be oozing
away. Fate! Fate! and no hand of man was
fighting against him! What could he do but
submit? Shuddering, he covered his face with
his hands. He must hide it away. He must
forget. He must clear his mind from the stupefaction
that was stealing over it, or all would be
lost. But it was in vain, for, with his every
effort, he seemed only to sink more deeply into
despondency and bewilderment.</p>

<p>Suddenly a sound came to him. It was as
vivid to his sense as is the light of morning to
the belated traveller&mdash;a voice clear and strong.
'Why,' it said, 'should this thing startle you?
If a vision was granted to you, if you saw,
beforehand, what would be in the future, and if
now the vision is followed by what is, or appears
to be, a reality, is that any reason why your
strength and presence of mind should desert
you?' A pause, and then, answering the thought
of his heart, the voice went on, 'Fate! That
is true. Everything is fate. But our resistances
are predicted and foreseen as well as our trials.
Arise and be of good cheer. This is no omen
of evil, but rather of good. You say that the
vision is not over. Again you are right. There
is more to come, and in due time and place you
will behold it; but tie not your limbs from
present use in consideration of that which they
may have to do in the future. In coming hither
you have chosen rightly. She, like you, must
"dree her dread"; but the Holy Ones love her,
and will have her in Their keeping. Listen!'</p>

<p>At this moment&mdash;it seemed a strange and
incongruous thing&mdash;there broke in upon the
eager spiritual colloquy a sound so ridiculously
common and familiar that, uneasy as he was,
Tom could almost have laughed. It was the
discordant rattle with which, in India, a snake-charmer
and conjuror calls his audience together.
The sounds came from behind Tom. Turning
in haste, he saw a hooded snake rearing up its
ugly neck and head within a few feet of him.
Behind the snake, sitting crouched together and
eyeing him curiously, was an old man, with coal-black
face, white hair, and supernaturally bright
eyes. He was wrapped in a dirty white
chuddah; a cloth, containing his implements of
trade, lay outspread before him, and he held in
his hand a light wand, with which he was
directing the movements of the snake.</p>

<p>When Tom turned he stopped his jabber for
a moment to beg him not to be afraid, adding
impressively that if he would only have patience,
he would behold such a sight as he had never
seen before. 'Others kill,' cried the old man,
looking round on the soldiers who, pleased at
any sort of fun, were crouching about him.
'They bring you a mongoose. There is a fight.
The monster is killed. He lies stiff and stark
before you. You clap your hands like silly
children. But what is that? Nothing. I snap
my fingers at them. No mongoose here, good
sirs! No killing! I did not say no fight. Yes,
you love fighting, and a fight you shall see!
But a man will fight the monster; a man with
his naked hands, and it shall be&mdash;not killed&mdash;but
tamed! That is the true triumph, my
masters&mdash;the true revenge! My enemy's blood,
what is it? For a moment it fills my nostrils
with its savour, in the next it is gone. But to
tame him, to see him lie down at my feet and
lick my hand, to spurn him once, and yet again;
day after day to behold him grovel more deeply
before me. This is joy! This is ecstasy! And
it is this, in little, which I call you to behold.'</p>

<p>He spoke in a high key, and with the most
extraordinary rapidity, holding his wand, as he
spoke, over the head of the cobra, which moved
uneasily from side to side as if it were trying
to escape from some fascinating influence. His
voice dropped and there was a lull. The serpent
gazed at him sleepily. He crooned a low song,
which seemed to have a stupefying effect upon
it, for it dropped and lay like dead. The soldiers,
meantime, stirred to the entrails by his address,
showed all the symptoms of intoxication; some
rolling about in speechless ecstasy, others
dancing, singing, and shouting, so that, in a few
moments, the camp was changed into a field of
demons.</p>

<p>There came a cry from the snake-charmer.
'Give me room&mdash;room!' and, in the next instant,
he had flung his wand aside, thrown off
his chuddah, and leapt to his feet. At the same
moment the serpent reared itself up, shot out its
forked tongue, and threw its sinuous body at
the man, who received it on his knotted arms.
The hideous combat went on for some minutes.
Now the man seemed to triumph and now the
serpent. Tom was sick with loathing; but he
could not turn away. An invincible fascination,
helped by a suspicion that the combat had some
mysterious importance for himself, kept his eyes
fixed.</p>

<p>Suddenly the silence of the camp was broken.
There came a cry of, 'Give place! The Ranee is
coming!'</p>

<p>The combat was at its height&mdash;the man
almost lost in the folds of the cobra, and the
awe-stricken circle falling back&mdash;when Tom,
who had kept his position near the snake-charmer,
saw her come out. She was dressed
in the brilliant robe of black and gold in which
he had seen her first, and covered from head to
foot, so that he could not see her face. With
slow and dignified step she advanced towards
them. She had crossed half the space that
separated her from the snake. It had loosened
itself from the man, and was turning in this new
direction. Unable to restrain himself, Tom
darted forward. 'Keep back!' he cried in
English. 'You are mad!'</p>

<p>She spread out her arms, waved him back
imperiously, and moved forward. At the same
moment Tom saw on the face of the snake-charmer
a look of such anguish and dismay that
he thought his enemy had conquered and given
him a deadly wound. Yet the snake had
dropped and was lying at his feet, not dead, but
spent.</p>

<p>Confused and troubled, Tom fell back. The
lady was advancing still. She was within a few
feet of the snake. Its master warned her back,
but she took no heed of him. Then Tom, who
could bear it no longer, turned away and
covered his face with his hands. There was a
moment of absolute silence. His heart beat
with curious rapidity, there was a singing in his
ears that almost deprived him of the power of
hearing, and though feeling that this would be
the time to get away, he seemed to lack the
power to move a step. All at once there was a
shout. It was followed by another, and then
by another, 'Victory! victory! Our Ranee-jee,
daughter of the Prophet, protected of Allah,
has triumphed!' The cries rang through the
camp, were taken up by those who clustered
round it, and echoed back from the village, so
that in a moment all the country seemed alive.</p>

<p>At the sounds Tom turned, and this was the
strange sight he saw. In the centre of the vast
circle and at some little distance from the snake-charmer,
who, recognising probably a master in
his craft, had drawn back, and was now close at
Tom's elbow, stood the Ranee. She stood with
her head proudly raised, so that she looked
taller than before. One little foot was planted
firmly on the ground, the other rested on the
neck of the cobra, which cowered before her as
if smitten with sudden fear. But the strangest
part of all was that the black and gold saree
had been thrown back and that her face was
exposed. With parted lips Tom gazed. It was
the face of a little child, soft and white, with
rose-red lips, and smiling eyes, in which the
golden light of summer dawns seemed to be
sleeping, and&mdash;if he was not mad&mdash;if he was
not dreaming&mdash;he had seen it before.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h5><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a></h5>

<h4>SUBDUL</h4>


<p>Tom's first idea was that she, like himself, was a
prisoner, and he was about to commit the terrible
imprudence of flinging himself at her feet,
and begging her to accept his protection, when
the snake-charmer passing him by, brushed him
as if by accident, and pausing, made a low
salaam, and breathed an apology. There was
a look in his face which arrested Tom's attention;
under cover of the clamour which had
not ceased, he said in a low voice and in
Marathi, which was known to his spies, 'Are
you a friend?'</p>

<p>'I am his Highness's servant,' said the man,
'and I will help him to escape; but he must be
prudent. The White Ranee is black of heart.'
As he muttered the last words, speaking
them in so low a tone that no one but Tom
could hear, he was moving towards the Ranee.
She greeted him with a smile of childlike triumph,
and he prostrated himself at her feet. Then,
resuming his wand, and singing his lullaby-song,
he enticed the monster into its basket, while the
Ranee, having looked round her proudly, threw
the black and gold saree about her head, and
returned to the tent. The snake-charmer began
now to circulate among the soldiers. He was
full of stories and jests, and wherever he went
he was received with acclamations. Tom, who
had taken up his station under the tree to which
Snow-queen was tethered, watched him moving
to and fro. Presently he noticed a strange
thing. It was only as long as the snake-charmer
was in the midst of each little group that its
members were joyous or lively. As soon as he
left them they became silent, most of them falling
shortly into a heavy sleep. This must have
been apparent to others besides himself, yet
there were none who did not watch for and expect
his coming. Night had fallen before he had
made his round of the camp, and then all, with
the exception of two sentinels outside the tent,
were in a deep slumber. He crept now to the
neighbourhood of Tom's station, and professed to
curl himself up for sleep. The sentinels watched
him drowsily. After a few minutes of perfect
silence, one of them sat down and leaned his back
against a tree. His comrade followed his example.
They exchanged a few remarks to keep themselves
awake. One drank from a bottle in his
girdle and offered it to the other, whereupon their
dropping remarks fell off into silence. And now
no one in all the camp was awake but Tom and
the snake-charmer.</p>

<p>It was nearing midnight, but the moon&mdash;which
was on the wane, but which in this clear
atmosphere diffuses a brilliant light&mdash;enabled
them to see their way, and they both arose.</p>

<p>'Now is our time,' said the snake-charmer,
chuckling. He was none other than Subdul,
Snow-queen's groom.</p>

<p>'Are you sure they are well settled?' said
his master.</p>

<p>'I have given them bhang, Highness. That,
and the excitement of the evening, will make
them sleep like the dead; no noise will awake
them. But the nights are short; why does my
master linger?'</p>

<p>'Are you sure <i>she</i> is not a prisoner, Subdul?
Might she not come with us if we told her our
design?'</p>

<p>'If my master means the Ranee, I tell him
that she is black&mdash;black at heart and false of
speech. Let not my master trust her.'</p>

<p>'What do you know of her, Subdul?'</p>

<p>'I know what these have told me. Does my
lord know Dost Ali Khan?'</p>

<p>'The adopted son of the rajah of that name?'
cried Tom, with some excitement; 'why, I
entertained him once. I have now a pass from
him about me. Has he anything to do in this?'</p>

<p>'He has everything to do. He is the hope
of thousands. They crowd round him as their
lord. If my master has won Dost Ali Khan's
favour he is lucky. This man, my lord, this
so-called prince, has, as I hear, persuaded the
White Ranee to join herself to him. She was
married to an English sahib, and she saw him
slain. She looked on at the slaughter of her
countrymen and women, and now, in her new
lord's name, she is taking command of the
murderers. If my master wants any more proof
that she is a traitress&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Silence, Subdul! She is coming!'</p>

<p>'Master! master!' cried the man in strong
excitement, 'now is the time to fly!'</p>

<p>'I must let her speak to me first.'</p>

<p>'No, no; let my master listen to me! She
is a witch; she will enslave him.'</p>

<p>'Nonsense, Subdul; I know her, I tell you.
Be silent!' murmured Tom, whose heart was
beating strangely.</p>

<p>And all this time the White Ranee, with veil
thrown back, and face looking pure and spiritual
in the moonlight, was making her way quietly
through the sleepers of the camp towards the
spot where Tom was standing. They were
alone now, Subdul having disappeared. Tom
did not move, for a spell seemed to be over him;
so she went close to him and laid her hand on
his arm. Then a sudden trembling seized him.</p>

<p>'Who are you?' he said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>'Surely you know me,' she answered. 'I
know you, Tom Gregory. Why did you run
away from Delhi without seeing me again?'</p>

<p>'Why are you here?' he said sternly.</p>

<p>'You are impolite, my dear boy. A question
should be answered.'</p>

<p>'This is no time or place for amenities, and
you know it. Answer me! Are you a prisoner?
For if so I will take you away with me and protect
you honourably until I can restore you to
your own people. If you are not a prisoner&mdash;if
you have given yourself up to the enemies
of your race, then I will leave you to reap your
own punishment.'</p>

<p>The lady laughed. 'So stern all of a sudden!'
she said.</p>

<p>'You are playing with me. You are wasting
time.'</p>

<p>'Time was made for slaves, Tom,' said the
lady, in a sweet girlish treble, 'and I am not a
slave; neither are you. Sit down under this
tree, and let us talk together quietly. Ah! how
pleasant it is to speak to an Englishman again!'</p>

<p>'Vivien! are you mad?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I am mad, always mad, Tom; but
madder than ever now. Be mad with me; you
have no idea how delightful it is to live in a
dream!'</p>

<p>'The dream will soon be over, my poor
child. Do you think that you can tame men as
you tame serpents?'</p>

<p>'Think? I am sure of it, Tom!'</p>

<p>'Then, if this is your dream, for heaven's
sake awake! Good God! why do you look at
me so?' cried the young fellow, in a sudden
transport.</p>

<p>She was standing before him in the moonlight,
her golden hair blown this way and that
way with the wind, her eyes full of laughter,
an expression half-mocking, half-pitiful, playing
about her lips.</p>

<p>'Do you know how awful this time is?' he
said. 'Are you human?'</p>

<p>She laughed. 'No,' she said, 'I don't think
I am. Take my advice, Tom, and be inhuman
too!'</p>

<p>'Vivien, you are playing with me!'</p>

<p>'Of course I am; I never do anything but
play. I played with you, and if it had not been
for Grace Elton, who is a very serious young
person, I should have won you over as a playfellow.
I played with Charlie Doncaster, poor
boy! But he had not my animal spirits, and he
was beginning to be grave and tiresome when&mdash;but
I don't want to talk of disagreeable
things. Well! The next was his Royal or
Imperial Highness, Dost Ali Khan. I wonder,
by the bye, if you remember him. I was within
an ace of running over him in the streets of
Delhi. It would have been a good thing for
some people if I had succeeded. You saved
him, didn't you? Set that as a make-weight
against all your good deeds, Mr. Tom, and see
what the result will be! But to return, as the
story-tellers say. I was so much amused with
his Highness that I took the trouble to cultivate
him; and it was a very funny little episode, I
can assure you. Heavens! how he hated me at
first! I tell him sometimes that I am surprised he
did not kill me, for I gave him heaps and heaps
of chances. He let me live, however, against
his better judgment, I believe, and now he is
my slave. I can do whatever I like with him.
What do you say to that for a game?'</p>

<p>'I say that you are mad&mdash;that you don't
know what you are saying, and the night is
passing. No more of this folly! Will you come
with me or will you not?'</p>

<p>'Tom, what a baby you are! Never mind,
I like you so! But be a wise baby if you can,
and listen to me quietly. I am <i>not</i> going with
you. It would be absurd to begin with, and
highly dangerous, all through. On the other
hand, having found you, I don't mean to let you
slip out of my fingers. So you must come with
me. I must tell you that you have been so
fortunate as to make Dost Ali Khan, his
Imperial Highness of the future, your friend.
He is the great man just now, for he is the only
person in this part of the world who knows
what he wants, so the rest of them look up to
him. The soldiers, banded and disbanded, the
native states, the fanatics of the towns, they are
all waiting for his signal. When he gives it&mdash;Heavens!
I begin to feel sane, as I think of it&mdash;what
a conflagration there will be! However,
that is beside the present question'&mdash;she
stopped to laugh. 'I think I am speaking
rather weightily,' she said; 'don't you? Now, to
go on in the same strain, this exalted personage,
whose ally I am, offers you his friendship.
He doesn't wish you to fight for or with him,
for he believes you would say "No," and he has a
sort of conscience about destroying you. What
he asks is that you will take me into Gumilcund&mdash;think
of the magnanimity of it!&mdash;and keep me
there until the explosion is over. Then, if the
world doesn't meanwhile fall in ruins about us,
we can decide about the future.'</p>

<p>She paused and went a little closer to him.
A cloud had veiled the face of the moon so that,
near as she was, he could only see her indistinctly;
but he felt her&mdash;felt her in every nerve
of his being, and for a moment he hesitated.
Why should he not, after all, take her back to
Gumilcund first, and leave her there in safety
before setting forth on any other mission of
rescue? He did not believe all she had told
him. Either she was mad&mdash;as she said of herself&mdash;and
in that case she ought to be protected
from the results of her own mad actions; or else
she was playing with him. Yes, she had herself
spoken the word. But was she accountable for
her own strange nature? Should she be punished
because she could not see the awful realities
that lay about her? Since, by some strange
freak of fortune, she had been able so far to
gain protection, was he to deny her the asylum
that would make her safety sure?</p>

<p>While he reasoned with himself she stood by
him. She did not speak, she did not stir; but
as the silence prolonged itself a sigh, soft as the
breath of a sleeping child, escaped her lips.</p>

<p>'Vivien!' he said tremulously, 'is that
you?'</p>

<p>'Yes, it is I; I am near you. You will come
with me, Tom?' she murmured; and, in low
caressing tones, 'Dearest Tom!'</p>

<p>'Why do you say that?' he said, hoarsely.</p>

<p>'Listen to him, poor child!' she cried.
'Why? Can't you tell? Can't you imagine?'</p>

<p>'You are false!' he groaned; 'you have said
it of yourself!'</p>

<p>'False to others, Tom; never to you!'</p>

<p>'False to one is false to all.'</p>

<p>'Listen to him!' she cried again. 'What
an exalted standard! But, my young king, let
me tell you that you are ungrateful and unjust.
If I could only save <i>you</i> by being false to
<i>others</i>; if every subterfuge, from the beginning,
was planned for this&mdash;that I might have <i>you</i>;
that I might hold <i>your</i> life in my hands&mdash;what
then?'</p>

<p>'Is it so?' he said hoarsely.</p>

<p>'You see!' she cried; 'you were cold because
you did not understand!'</p>

<p>At this moment, when his will was passing
away from him, and his heart was as wax in
the midst of his body, there came a strange
and sudden disturbance. Subdul Khan had
been crouching behind them; his ear was to
the ground, and all his senses were on the
alert, for he feared treachery. Whether he
did actually hear in the distance the rumble
of gun-carriages and the sound of armed men
on the march, or whether he merely professed
to hear them to arouse his master, cannot be
certainly known; but the effect was the same.
Suddenly, with a cry of, 'The rebels are upon
us!' he sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>Snow-queen was saddled, and so was the
horse of Subdul Khan. They mounted them
together, and while Vivien, with a ringing cry,
to which none of the besotted men about her
paid any heed, ran frantically through the
camp, Snow-queen and her master, going like
the wind, disappeared in the distance.</p>

<h4>AN AWFUL RIDE AND A RESCUE</h4>


<p>Hurry on, brave men! let the wind be your
messenger; stop neither to eat nor drink;
through the long sultry day and at nightfall,
when the awful eye of day is closed and the
stars come out pale and languid overhead, even
until morning dawns and the terrible round of
sweltering heat and blinding dust begins again&mdash;hurry
on! By narrow and unfrequented ways,
through villages whose favour has been bought,
under the shade of trees, and across tracts of
jungle, where you are obliged to go at a foot-pace,
giving breathing time to the gallant beasts
that have carried you so bravely&mdash;on and ever
on, for two dreadful days and nights, that to
one of you seem ever afterwards like an awful
dream. And yet, you are too late. And well it
may be for yourselves that you did not arrive
earlier. For the storm has broken. In fire,
and blood, and fever it is spreading from city to
city, and Jhansi, the home and citadel of a
woman scorned, has caught the dread contagion.</p>

<p>Up to June 1 they were at peace. The
Ranee still sat smiling in her palace, and
still she added to her body-guard persons of
proved loyalty, and still the English believed
her promises, and still the troops within the
city proclaimed their faithfulness loudly. And
why did the English need to fear? Meerut had
not moved them. Delhi had not moved them.
The native states, Gwalior and Gumilcund, and
Rewah and Banda, were holding their hands.
Nay, it was known that some of them had
offered help to the Paramount Power in the
re-establishment of order; and even if they had
feared, what could they do? To show mistrust
at this eleventh hour would be to undo all that
had gone before, and to ruin everything.</p>

<p>On June 3 mysterious fires broke out; but
even these did not unduly alarm them. They
were attributed to accident. It was not until
the 4th that their eyes were opened. Then
the soldiers on parade, breaking away suddenly
and causelessly as it appeared to those who had
not heard of the secret messages that had been
passing between the palace and the native lines,
shot down their sergeant and seized the
artillery, and with it made their way to the fort
within the native city.</p>

<p>The Ranee still sat smiling in her palace;
but when the news came to her she ordered the
palace gates to be opened, mounted her horse
and cantered over to the lines with her own
faithful body-guard, who in her name had
seized upon the treasury, behind her.</p>

<p>Some of the English officers had been hurrying
to her palace. They were told on the way
that she was in the hands of the mutineers, and
instantly the full magnitude of what had happened
darted upon them. They dashed back to
the cantonments, calling as they went on the
English and Eurasians to follow them into the
Star Fort, the only building belonging to them
now that was capable of defence. It all happened
in a moment. Some of them had not even
heard of the disturbance on parade. In the
little house, once a tomb on the maidan, something
had been seen; but no one clearly understood
what had happened. 'Father will be in
presently, and then we shall hear,' said Mrs.
White to her little Aglaia, as she tried to soothe
her off to sleep. But then the ayah rushed in
like a wild creature, and with a cry of 'They
are coming; hide!' tore the child out of her
arms. She knew little more. Some one came
and dragged her out of the house, and she was
mounted on a horse, to which, crying out for her
child, she clung because she could not help
herself, and there was a mad, sick flight across
the blaze of the maidan, with yells at her heels,
which seemed to recede as she flew on, and then
all at once she was in the Fort amongst a circle
of frightened women, and her husband, who had
not come for her himself, having work to do,
was with the men, but her child&mdash;her little
darling&mdash;was nowhere to be seen. She made a
wild rush for the door. Even amongst the
rebels there must be some one who would have
mercy upon her. When they held her back by
force her shrieks and cries were piteous to hear.</p>

<p>But all were not so helpless. In the little
spell of time given them by the rebels who were
quarrelling over the booty, the men looked up
the stores of ammunition, and barricaded doors
and windows, and allotted to every combatant
his post, and to every non-combatant his duty;
and the women gathered together the food which
the more provident had brought in, soothed the
children, and made arrangements for the night.</p>

<p>No one, meanwhile, could tell poor Mrs.
White anything of her child. It was known,
however, that some of the little English community
had yet to come in, and the sanguine
hoped that Aglaia, who was a general favourite,
might be amongst them. Others feared that
the ayah, seized by panic, or deliberately
treacherous, had given her up.</p>

<p>Late that afternoon, when those in the Fort
had made all their dispositions, the mutineers
came clustering round, crying out that they
should surrender. They were received by a
strong and well-directed fire, which laid many
of them low. This was not what they had
bargained for, so they retreated in some confusion
to deliberate.</p>

<p>Slowly and awfully the first night in the Fort
passed by. The women slept, or tried to sleep.
The men, fearing surprise, were on the watch.
Early in the morning such food as they had was
distributed with a little water and wine. Then
two bold fellows&mdash;Eurasians&mdash;undertook to go
out in disguise and try to bring relief from the
nearest European station. Hopeless task! They
were cut down before they were well clear of the
cantonments. Those inside, meanwhile, heard
guns being dragged into position to batter them
to pieces. This attempt was soon given up, for
the defenders of the Fort, several of whom were
dead shots, peppered the artillery-men so freely,
that after a score or so had been shot down, no
one could be found to undertake the duty. If
only there had been water and food in the Fort
the defence might have been heard of with that
of Arah. But hunger and thirst are to besieged
men the deadliest of foes. No one could
believe, moreover, that the good Ranee, though
misguided by evil counsellors, could actually
permit the slaughter of her English friends.
After a little discussion it was decided that three
officers, each of whom was well known to her,
should go out as envoys, and treat with her for
the surrender of the Fort. They went out gaily,
but they never returned. 'What have I to do
with English swine?' said the Ranee, when they
were brought before her. The haughty words
were their sentence. At her palace gates they
were cut down; and the story of their fate was
shouted derisively under the windows of the
Fort.</p>

<p>Another council was held. The provisions, it
was found, would, with economy, last another
three days. It was hoped that, in the meantime,
their desperate situation might be heard of, and
a relief attempted. For another dreadful day
and night they held out.</p>

<p>The morning of the third day dawned. The
watchers were half dead with fatigue and
anxiety; the children were crying out piteously
for water; the women were faint, weary, and
disheartened. When the sun rose the rebels
made an attack in force; but they were driven
back, and there were two or three hours of rest.</p>

<p>Then the Ranee sent the besieged a message.
All she wanted was the Fort. Let those within
surrender it, and they would be allowed to go
in peace whither they desired.</p>

<p>Upon this another council was held. The
boldest were for holding out. There was, indeed,
little or no hope of successful resistance;
but, if they must die, it would be better to die
at their posts, fighting, like brave men, than to
fall into the hands of their cruel and treacherous
enemies. Had they been all men and combatants,
this is the course they would have
taken. Unhappily the larger number of the
fifty and odd souls who were clustered together
in the Fort were women and little children and
men of peace. To them, as others urged, this
offer of the Ranee gave the one and only loophole
of escape that they could hope for, and so,
with heavy hearts and ominous forebodings of
evil, the brave men, who had counselled resistance,
laid down their arms, the gates of the
Fort were thrown open, and the Ranee's bodyguard
marched in.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the afternoon which witnessed the surrender
of the English into the hands of the
Ranee, two horsemen crossed the boundaries of
the state, and stopped at a small village where
one of them had friends. These advised them
strongly to go no further, alleging that something
extraordinary had been happening in the
city. The two men refreshed themselves and
their horses, and galloped on to a grove, which
lay off the road, at a little distance from the
village. Here, their horses being completely
spent, they dismounted and let them rest. As
they stood, with their hands on their bridle-reins,
ready to mount and gallop at the least
alarm, there came to their ears a rumbling
noise as of distant thunder, and one of them&mdash;the
master&mdash;said, 'We are too late. It has
begun.'</p>

<p>'We are too late, Excellency. There is
nothing for us to do now but to return whence
we came,' answered the man.</p>

<p>'Go back you, Subdul! I must enter
Jhansi, and see with my own eyes what is going
on.'</p>

<p>'My master is not wise. He will not be able
to help, and he will risk his own life, which is
dear to his people.'</p>

<p>'Listen, Subdul!' said the young rajah,
impressively. 'I have a friend in that city&mdash;a
little child. She loves me and believes in me.
All night long, while we were riding and resting,
she has been beside me. I tell you it is no
dream; it is a reality. She is calling me, and
I must go. I must save my poor little Aglaia,
or perish in the attempt. But you have no
such call; and why should two of us risk our
lives? Stay here, where you are known, or go
back to Gumilcund.'</p>

<p>'Does his Excellency think that I would
desert him?' said Subdul Khan, sorrowfully.
'He has seen what I can do. Let him give
himself into my hands, and I will take him
safely into Jhansi.'</p>

<p>'Make your own arrangements, Subdul; but
remember that life or death may hang on the
next few moments.'</p>

<p>'I will use every diligence,' said Subdul, and
he mounted his horse and rode off, leaving Tom
alone in the wood.</p>

<p>For more than an hour he waited patiently,
and then, just as dusk was beginning to fall,
Subdul came back. He had changed his dress
and the accoutrements of his horse, so that at
first his master failed to recognise him; but,
just as he was grasping his weapon to defend
himself, he heard his servant's voice.</p>

<p>'Does not my master know me?'</p>

<p>'Scarcely. What have you done to yourself?'</p>

<p>'I am in the dress of the Ranee's body-guard,
Excellency. I met one of them. He was drunk
with bhang, and red with the slaughter of your
Excellency's countrymen. I drew him into a
solitary place, slew him, and took his garments.'</p>

<p>Tom gave an involuntary shudder, for he
was new to this kind of thing; but he made no
remark. Mounting his horse, he followed Subdul
out of the wood. They avoided the high
road, and, the dimness of the light favouring
them, crept along under the shadow of trees
and walls until they reached the outskirts of
the city. The open maidan lay now between
them and the Star Fort.</p>

<p>'Stop,' whispered Subdul, as his master was
about to gallop across it. 'Let his Excellency
stay here for a few minutes! I will go forward
and see what has happened, and come back to
him. In this dress I can mix amongst them,
and they will suppose me one of themselves.'</p>

<p>'Go,' said Tom; 'but come back quickly, or
I shall not be able to bear it.'</p>

<p>They were close to a mass of ruined masonry,
which rose between them and the town.
Sheltering himself behind it, Tom looked and
listened. From the city came a tumult of fierce
cries and trampling feet; here and there clouds
of smoke darkened the sky, and tongues of
lurid flame darting from their midst would, for
a few moments, light up the scene of ruin.</p>

<p>Tom's heart sank, and his breath came and
went pantingly. He knew that Subdul was
right, that for him to rush into the pandemonium
before him would be ruin to himself and useless
for others, and yet it was only with the greatest
difficulty that he could preserve his patience.</p>

<p>Subdul, meantime, was pricking across the
maidan. In the place where the cantonments
had been, but which was now a shapeless mass
of ruins, he met a body of sepoys. They had
lanterns in their hands, and they were looking
about for the gold and jewels which the Feringhees
had left behind them. He pulled up, told
them he had lost his way in the darkness, and
asked where his comrades&mdash;the Ranee's bodyguard&mdash;were.
'Guarding the Feringhees' treasure,'
said one of the men. 'The Ranee has
taken it, but we mean to have our share.'</p>

<p>'Tell her so,' cried another, with a rude jest.</p>

<p>'What is that to me?' said Subdul. 'I
obey orders. The Feringhees are slain?'</p>

<p>'Every man, woman, and child,' answered
the soldier, savagely.</p>

<p>'How was it?' said Subdul. 'I have come
in from the country, where I have been visiting
my father, and I know nothing.'</p>

<p>The party of sepoys, most of whom were
intoxicated, for they had ransacked the officers'
wine-stores, broke into a loud laugh.</p>

<p>'By Allah!' cried one, 'I never thought to
see such a sight. The infidels were in the Fort,
pouring out blasphemies, and shooting down
the sons of the Prophet like sheep. The evil
one helped them, for they were few in number.
It was hot work, brother: and who cares to die
in the moment of victory? Our mother, the
Ranee, who is a true daughter of the Prophet,
saw how it was with us, and promised them
their lives if they would give her up the Fort.
They believed her word, and came out. Then
we bound them and carried them to the yokan
Bagh, where we fell upon them with the sword.
There were fifty in all; men, women, and
children. The women cried for mercy, and
some of us delayed to smite, that we might hear
them. But the orders were to be swift, so we
finished them; and there they lie, unburied, for
the vultures and jackals to feed upon. So may
all enemies of the Prophet perish!'</p>

<p>He was answered by a shout that rang
through the ruins. Subdul's fingers were playing
with his sword; but he restrained himself,
and said mildly, 'My brother is a man of war,
and his deeds will win for him a place in Paradise!
Will he tell me where this garden is? I
have an enemy amongst the slain Feringhees,
and I would fain see him with my own eyes.'</p>

<p>The sepoy, to whom this was a most natural
request, pointed with his finger to the opposite
side of the maidan. 'There is a ruined mosque
close by,' he said. 'The fathers of the devils we
have slain desecrated it, and it has never been
rebuilt since.'</p>

<p>'I know the place,' answered Subdul.
Sweeping round, he left them to their devices,
and, after a few minutes of rapid riding, rejoined
his master.</p>

<p>'What news?' said Tom.</p>

<p>'The worst!' answered Subdul; and he
repeated what he had heard, adding that the
garden where the dreadful deed had been done
was close by the spot where they were standing.</p>

<p>For a few moments Tom was paralysed.
This was worse&mdash;far worse&mdash;than he had
dreamed.</p>

<p>'Women and children!' he groaned.</p>

<p>'Every one of them, Excellency.'</p>

<p>'The brutes! The devils! Subdul, if we
had only a score of our Gumilcund men at our
back&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'We could do nothing, Excellency. There
are hundreds in the city.'</p>

<p>'Cowards! every mother's son of them. I
should have come with an army; but it is too
late now. Let us look for the child.'</p>

<p>'Have I not told your Excellency that all
were slain?'</p>

<p>'Aglaia is not dead! I am certain of it.
Are you afraid to come into the garden where
they lie, Subdul?'</p>

<p>'I will lead the way!' answered the man.</p>

<p>It was within a stone's-throw of the ruined
mosque where they had been hiding&mdash;an enclosed
space surrounded with walls, and set out
with grim old trees, plots of yellow marigold,
and shrubberies where roses, Cape jessamine, the
champa, and the asoka grew. Once it had been
a haunt and favourite pleasure-ground of the
Ranee, who, in the days of her power, had built
a pavilion in its centre. Now it was seldom
used.</p>

<p>The two men found the gates open and the
place deserted. Not a single soldier was left on
guard. The murderers had done their foul
work, and had gone away to their triumph and
plunder, leaving the speechless witnesses of their
treachery behind them. As, putting his horse
to a foot-pace, Tom groped his way through the
darkness, his heart contracted and his limbs
trembled under him. Rather a thousand times
would he have met a hundred foes in fair fight
than this. Eagerly, meanwhile, he looked and
listened, hoping against hope, that some might
have escaped. Nothing was to be seen but the
heavy foliage of the trees that blotted out the
moonlight. Nothing was to be heard but the
night-breeze as it played with their branches.</p>

<p>Suddenly a shriek, penetrating and prolonged,
broke upon the silence. Another and
another followed. They came up from the distance,
and swept towards the riders, nearer and
nearer, until, with a rush like a blast of wind
in a narrow place, they passed them by. Sick
with horror, Tom pulled up. Subdul struck a
match, set fire to a torch of brushwood which
he had been making as they went along, and
swung it round his head, upon which there was
another wild flight, and another prolonged
shriek, which went on for a few moments and
then died away in the distance.</p>

<p>'The wild creatures have scented the deed
of blood,' said Subdul. 'These are jackals!
And see, my master, see!'</p>

<p>As he spoke they came into an open space
and Subdul waved his torch again. On the
instant there was an awful, indescribable tumult,
and in the next the heavens were darkened by
the wings of gigantic birds. For a few moments
they hovered overhead, casting their dread
shadows on the moonlit earth, and then sailed
slowly away to the grove which the riders had
left.</p>

<p>'Does my master wish to see more?' said
Subdul. 'They are there.' He pointed to a
group of trees near the centre of the garden,
under which they could faintly distinguish a
mass of something dark.</p>

<p>'Subdul! Subdul!' cried the young fellow,
piteously. 'I cannot bear it.'</p>

<p>'There is no need. I told my master that
he could do nothing. Let us consider our own
safety and go back,' said Subdul.</p>

<p>'But if any of them should be alive.'</p>

<p>'It is impossible. The fiends have done
their work too well.'</p>

<p>'I must look for the child, Subdul. If she
is there&mdash;but she cannot be; she cannot.'</p>

<p>'Listen,' said Subdul. 'What is that?'</p>

<p>They stopped. A low piping, sweet and clear,
like the voice of an English song-bird in the
fresh dawn of the summer morning, fell upon
their ears. It came from a rose thicket, which
lay to the right of the path. In a second Tom
was on his feet and had thrown his reins to
Subdul Khan. He stood for a moment listening,
moving softly in the direction whence the sounds
had come, and then stood again. He could now
hear a little flutter, as of frightened breathing,
and could dimly discern a white figure moving
amongst the bushes.</p>

<p>With a beating heart he went nearer. A fugitive,
probably a native servant, who would be
able to tell him what he desired to know. He
was almost afraid of moving, lest he should startle
her, and was pondering how he could make
known that he was a friend, when the piping bird-like
voice, which he had first heard, began again:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">There is a happy land, Far, far away,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Where saints in glory stand, Bright, bright as day.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Sweetly the baby-voice lisped the sweet words.
He could scarcely restrain himself. He made
an involuntary movement, and the voice of the
woman, faint with terror, came towards him:
'Hushee! Hushee! Missy Sahib. Some one is
near.'</p>

<p>'God is near,' piped the sweet little voice.
'I saw His wings. They were so big, so big! I want
Him to carry us away. I am so tired, and I don't
like hiding all this time. Do you think He will?'</p>

<p>'Missy! Missy!' cried the poor creature.
'Get up; come away. They have seen us.'</p>

<p>'Tom said he'd come,' murmured the child.</p>

<p>The poor woman seized the child in her
arms, but before she could run, a hand was laid
on her garments, and a voice, which, paralysed
as she was with terror, she recognised as the
voice of a friend, called her by her name.</p>

<p>In the next moment, Aglaia had leapt from
her arms, and was lying in the close embrace of
her friend. He could not speak. Man as he
was, his eyes were full of tears and his voice was
choked with sobs. Holding the child to his
breast, he guided the frightened ayah gently
over the broken ground. Then, as he recovered,
he began to murmur broken words of thanksgiving
and endearment. 'My little darling! My
treasure! You are safe! They may tear me
limb from limb, but they shall not hurt you.
Oh! thank God, thank God! that I have found
you.'</p>

<p>As for the child, she said not a word. She
clung to his neck. And so, coming back softly
they found Subdul and the horses, and set off
together&mdash;the child in Tom's arms, and the ayah
riding behind Subdul&mdash;for the village where
they had friends.</p>

<p>They went slowly, keeping close under the
shelter of trees and houses. No one molested them.
Fortunately for themselves they were in the outskirts
of the city and cantonments, and throughout
that dreadful night the revolted sepoys and
the Ranee's body-guard were too busy setting
fire to the Europeans' dwellings, and raking the
ashes for treasure, to pay any heed to stragglers.
In a short time they were out in the open
country, and now they rode on more securely.</p>

<p>Aglaia was fast asleep in Tom's arms. The
ayah had regained her powers of speech, and
she poured out her history of all that had happened.
The sahibs had gone into the Fort. She
would not take the child in, for she knew what
the soldiers were and she did not trust them.
She flew by a secret way to the garden, and
there they hid, she feeding the child on what
she could find.</p>

<p>Did little Missy ask for her mother? Oh!
yes, again and again; but she (ayah) told the
child that the Feringhees' God had taken her
away to stay in Paradise with Him, and she
was satisfied. They were in the garden when
the English were brought in, all of them bound
with cords. It had been a long and sultry day,
and the little one was asleep. Sumbaten heard,
she dared not look. There were cries, but
they were soon over, and then the soldiers went
away, and everything was still. 'Missy was
dreaming of you, Sahib,' she said to Tom, 'to-day
and the day before. She began to sing when
she awoke, and she said you were coming. Did
your God tell her?'</p>

<p>He did not answer, but he pressed the child
closer to his heart.</p>

<p>Of their further journey there is no space
here to tell in any detail, nor do I know much
concerning its incidents. In my friend's diary
it is only briefly mentioned, and he suffers
from a curious confusion of ideas whenever he
thinks of it. It was due, doubtless, in a great
measure to the admirable arrangements which
Tom and his servants had made beforehand that
they were able to carry it through successfully,
for in every village on the route there were
those who knew the Rajah of Gumilcund, and
were ready to serve him. Once he was obliged
to fall back on the pass given to him by Dost
Ali Khan, who, as he presently found, was
becoming a power in the land. What he most
dreaded was an encounter with the White Ranee,
but, being careful to travel by night and along
the unfrequented routes, all of which were well-known
to Subdul, he succeeded in avoiding her.
He heard, however, that she continued to haunt
the district, and that her armed train was constantly
recruited by the soldiers whom Dost Ali
Khan seduced.</p>

<p>After that first night, Aglaia and the ayah
travelled in a litter, as ladies of high rank. The
child's skin was stained, so that she might pass
for an Indian, and Subdul, whose resources were
boundless, managed to get a suitable dress for
the ayah. As a general rule they camped out
in the open, when Aglaia would amuse them
with her quaint ways and sayings. Some
days she would be as happy as if nothing had
happened. At other times she cried piteously
for her mother and father, and it was only when
the ayah, who had a vivid imagination, assured
her that she had seen God carrying them away
to heaven that she would be pacified. 'Why
didn't He take me too?' she would sometimes
ask, a question which none of them found it
easy to answer.</p>

<p>Happily for herself she had not, like other
little ones, seen the horror that would ever after
haunt them like a nightmare; and, day by day,
as new scenes passed before her eyes, and fresh
experiences greeted her, the memory of her
nurse's frenzied flight, and of the two days in
the garden, grew fainter. She still thought of
her parents, but it was reproachfully, rather
than sadly. They might have taken her with
them when they went up to God. But this,
after all, was ayah's fault, rather than theirs.
Ayah had taken her away and hidden her.
Tom said she had hidden her for him, which to
Aglaia, who was now as deeply devoted to him
as she had been on board the 'Patagonia,' was
a sufficient explanation.</p>

<p>So, after several days and nights of travelling,
they reached the borders of Gumilcund.</p>

<p>What an entry it was! Stranger even and
more memorable than the young rajah's first
arrival in the city that he was called upon to
govern.</p>

<p>Runners had been sent out in every direction
to seek for him, and when, late in the afternoon
of a sultry June day, one of these came back
with the joyful news that their rajah, bringing
fugitives with him, was actually within the
boundaries of the state, the enthusiasm of the
people could no longer be suppressed. They
poured out in their hundreds, armed men accompanying
them, while in front of them rode
Chunder Singh, the minister, and Vishnugupta,
the priest, and when they saw the little group&mdash;the
litter and its bearers, and the two horsemen
riding beside it&mdash;joyous acclamations and
shouts of welcome, and ejaculations of praise
and thanksgiving, rent the air.</p>

<h4>CAPTAIN BERTIE'S FAQUIR</h4>


<p>In Meerut those days had been days of trouble.
On the 24th of May, the day following
General Elton's arrival in the city, a strong
detachment had marched out to join the troops
that were fighting their way to Delhi. Many of
the residents were of opinion that this decrease
in their defensive force would seriously affect
their safety; and night after night there were
panics. But nothing happened. The rebels,
who were daily and hourly being recruited by
fresh regiments, had higher game to fly at, and
it would not have suited their purpose to sit
down before a strong and well-provisioned place
like Meerut and wait for its surrender. This
the principal men of the station began to realise
at last, so that there was a greater sense of
security.</p>

<p>In the tent where the Eltons lived there was
deep distress and sorrow, for the General was
dangerously ill. Fatigue, exposure, and mental
anguish, aggravated by the pain of his wound,
which proved more serious than they had at
first imagined, had done their work. So long
as the strain was upon him he kept up. When
it was relaxed he fell. But for the perfection
of his health and the iron strength of his will,
he must have died that night. For himself, it
may have been fortunate that his senses soon
deserted him; but piteous it was to the poor
women who loved and honoured him to hear
the wild ravings of those awful days and nights.
It was all about his soldiers. They were his
children, his little ones. He believed in them,
as he believed in himself. Springing up in bed,
he would call the bystanders to witness how
brave and true they were. He would challenge
an imaginary adversary to question their faithfulness,
asserting his own intimate knowledge of
their character. Again and again he would
recite the brilliant deeds of arms to which he
had led them, and relate how they had delivered
him from a cruel death. His gentle wife, waiting
patiently by his bedside, wept bitterly as she
listened. With all her dread of the future, and
passionate sorrow and pity, she feared his returning
to himself. If he was to be taken away,
would it not be better for his sake that he should
go now, before his heart was pierced by the
dread knowledge of the truth? And as day
after day went by, bringing little or no change
in his condition, they began to fear that so it
would be.</p>

<p>There was another anxiety pressing upon
them. Through all these days no word had
been heard of Grace. Whether the troops at
Nowgong had been faithful, or whether they had
risen, no one at Meerut knew. To poor Lady
Elton, watching by her husband, and looking at
the pale faces of her girls, as they came and
went sorrowfully, doing what they could to help
her, it would seem sometimes as if Grace was
the dearest of all.</p>

<p>She was her first-born. It was her little
plaintive voice, and the touch of her baby-hands,
that had awakened in her heart the
rapturous joys of motherhood. From beautiful
girlhood she had blossomed under her eyes into
a womanhood that was no less lovely. Always
gentle, always good&mdash;too good, the mother said
to herself now, with a contraction of heart that
almost made her swoon. And it was not only
the dread of losing her. If she had lain where
her father lay, if they had known that in a short
time she would breathe her sweet life away,
bitter as the pang would have been, she might
have borne it. It was this horror worse than
death&mdash;this uncertainty&mdash;that slew her. It
numbed her senses, till she wondered at her own
indifference. It shattered her faith, so that,
forgetting the others&mdash;the young creatures who
depended upon her&mdash;she cried out piteously to
a cruel God to slay her, and then wept and bemoaned
herself over her own wickedness and
hardness of heart.</p>

<p>Sometimes those about her saw a wild look
in her eyes, as if she would do some desperate
deed. Yaseen Khan, the faithful bearer, who
could read her face as if it were an open book,
saw it, and, late one night, when he and she
were alone watching, he crept to Trixy's bedside
and awoke her. 'Mem Sahib is ill,' he said,
brokenly. 'Let Missy Sahib come and see.'</p>

<p>In a moment Trixy was on her feet. They
all slept in those days so as to be ready for any
alarm. 'What is it, Yaseen?' she said.</p>

<p>He led the way to the General's bedside, and
Trixy saw her mother, whom she had left sitting
beside him quietly in dressing-gown and
slippers, putting on her boots and throwing a
shawl about her shoulders. She looked up
when the girl approached her. 'I am glad you
have come, dear,' she said very quietly. 'Father
is asleep; I think he will do now, so I am going
to look for Grace. You will help Yaseen to take
care of him while I am away.'</p>

<p>'But, darling,' said Trixy, flinging her strong
young arms about her mother, and making her
sit down, 'you can't now. It is the middle of
the night.'</p>

<p>'That is why,' whispered poor Lady Elton;
'don't you see, you little goose, that they won't
let me go in the daytime? Now, like a good
child, loose me. There will be plenty of time for
kisses when Grace comes back.'</p>

<p>'Mother darling, you are dreaming. Will
you leave us all, father and the rest of us?
And you couldn't find her alone. Mother,
listen to me. God help us!' cried the poor
child, 'she doesn't understand. Yaseen, help
me! She will die if she goes out.'</p>

<p>'She will die! she will die!' echoed the poor
fellow. 'Missy Sahib, it is of no use.'</p>

<p>'It is of use, and she shall not die. Yaseen,
you are an idiot,' cried Trixy. 'Call Maud
Sahib, and run as fast as you can for the
doctor.'</p>

<p>The interruption, meanwhile, had confused
the unhappy mother, and she was looking before
her in bewilderment.</p>

<p>'He left the ninety-and-nine in the wilderness,'
she murmured, 'and went after the one
that was lost. Why did it come into my head?
I can't remember. And lost! Who is lost?
Not Grace, you silly child! She has been sitting
beside me all night. I thought she was being
hurt, but it was all imagination. No one could
hurt Grace.'</p>

<p>'No, no one;' echoed Trixy, whose eyes
were full of tears.</p>

<p>'There; I was sure of it. But your father
has been going on so strangely.'</p>

<p>'Father is asleep,' said Trixy. 'He will see
things more clearly when he awakes. You
ought to sleep, too, mother, and then you will
be ready to talk to him.'</p>

<p>'Sleep; yes, I should like to sleep, but I
can't. There is something strange in my head
and it keeps me awake. What is that? What
is that?'</p>

<p>'Only the doctor,' said Trixy, springing to
the curtain before the door of the tent. 'And&mdash;and&mdash;Bertie.'</p>

<p>Maud had joined them in the meantime.</p>

<p>She had more power over her mother than
Trixy, and between her and the doctor Lady
Elton was persuaded to take a composing
draught and to lie down. Trixy in the meantime
drew her friend Bertie aside. 'Something
must be done,' she said, 'or my poor mother
will go mad. Can't you help us?'</p>

<p>'God knows,' he answered earnestly, 'that I
would if I could. I asked to be allowed to take
out cavalry and scour the country. I feel
certain that I should have brought back news
at least. But I am forbidden. Lives, they say,
are too precious to be wasted in profitless enterprises.
If I had no command I would go out
alone.'</p>

<p>'That would be much too dangerous,' said
Trixy, shuddering. 'We must think of something
else. How would it do for one of us to
go out disguised?'</p>

<p>'One of <i>you</i>!' said Bertie with a sad smile.</p>

<p>'Well, <i>me</i>, if you will have it. I could dress
up as a native woman, and I know their way of
talking. Listen while I mimic ayah.'</p>

<p>'But, my dear girl, don't you know that the
poor native servants are as much hated as ourselves?
Numbers of them have been killed
already. Besides, what would you do?'</p>

<p>'I might at least find out where Grace is,
and then, perhaps, you would take out soldiers
to rescue her.'</p>

<p>'An impossible plan,' said the young fellow.
'But&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Well, Bertie, go on for heaven's sake!
Have you thought of anything?'</p>

<p>'I have made no plan, if that is what you
mean. I was only thinking&mdash;have you heard,
by the bye, where the young fellow is who visited
you here two months ago? You called him
Tom.'</p>

<p>'Curiously enough I was just thinking of
him,' said Trixy. 'He has large estates somewhere
in Central India, left him by a cousin or
some one of that sort, who was an Indian rajah.
Maud and I felt sure that he would become an
Indian too. He was very much changed when
we saw him. In England long ago he used to be
fond of Grace. What made you think of him
now?'</p>

<p>'I have just had rather a curious piece of
news. I meant to find out all I could about it,
and tell you later. They say that a new sort of
character has sprung up in these parts&mdash;an
English rajah. The story is so romantic that I
can scarcely believe it. The state he has come
over to govern is an ideal place, a kind of little
Paradise, so at least they tell me, where for the
last two or three generations the most admirable
laws have been in force. The late rajah seems
to have been half a philosopher and half a saint.
He bequeathed his rule to a young man brought
up in England, recommending him to his people
by a curious fiction. He said, it appears, that
in the person of this young man, who seems to
be strikingly like him, he would himself return
to the earth. If it was a stroke of policy, it was
clever and bold, for his people believed him.
The story goes that they received their new
rajah with acclamations.'</p>

<p>'It is Tom! I am sure it is Tom,' interrupted
Trixy, breathlessly. 'I heard the beginning of
the story at Surbiton. Father knows it all;
and they said then that he had seen visions.
Oh, how strange! how strange everything is!
Can't we send to him?'</p>

<p>'Wait a moment,' said Bertie. 'I have
more to tell you. The young rajah, who, of
course, is on our side in this struggle, has spies
everywhere, and he has managed to send one of
them into Meerut. I saw the man just now.
He looks like a faquir. They took him at the
outposts an hour or so ago, and he has been with
the General ever since. I heard from Hitchin,
who was in the General's quarters, that he was
from Gumilcund. I thought of waylaying him
presently, and trying to send a message to his
master.'</p>

<p>'You think of everything! What should
we do without you?' said Trixy, her eyes
glistening.</p>

<p>She lifted the curtain of the tent and looked
out.</p>

<p>'I should like to go too,' she said. 'It
would be so delightful to bring good news to
dearest mother. But I suppose&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'No, no; it would never do. You must
wait patiently a few minutes. I will come back
as soon as ever I can,' said Bertie.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the silence of the tent, with only sleepers
about her, Trixy waited. She would tell no
one of the great hope that had sprung up in her
heart, for fear it might be delusive; but she did
not think it would be, and rosy visions floated
before her as she sat watching. The darkness
waned, and the light came pouring in, and, remembering
suddenly her dishevelled condition,
she ran back to her own compartment of the
tent, and made herself trim and neat. Then she
looked in upon her father and mother, who
were, both of them, asleep. The doctor had
been with them since Yaseen Khan brought him
back. He smiled at the bright little maiden,
and told her that if she would have a cup of
coffee made for him he would remain with her
parents until they awoke.</p>

<p>'They are both better,' he said; 'but I
rather dread their coming to themselves.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' said Trixy, with a radiant smile. 'I
think I shall have good news for them.'</p>

<p>By this time the three other girls were stirring,
and Trixy, who wished to be the first to
hear the good news, went out into the compound.</p>

<p>It was scarcely day, for the sun had not
leapt above the hard rim of the horizon; but
there was a bright diffused light in the sky, and
the night-breeze was sinking to rest. This was
the hour when, in the dear old days of peace
and freedom, they used to return from their
morning ride, she and Bertie, as often as not,
riding together, and Maud and Lucy, each with
her own attendant, laughing and talking in front
of them. They never talked seriously. That
was not their way. Grace was the only serious
one of the family. Banter, and chaff, and jokes,
whose very feebleness made them laugh, formed
the staple of their talk. Then would come the
gay little breakfast in their lovely verandah,
crimson and purple and azure-blue flowers
peeping in at them between the pillars, and the
foliage of their glorious fig-tree making a screen
against the sun. As in a dream Trixy saw it all&mdash;her
gentle mother and Mildred, who was too
timid to ride, waiting for them, and the guests
who would drop in&mdash;the gallant young colonel
of General Elton's favourite regiment, who had
paid with his life for his reckless confidence in
his men, and the judge of the High Court, with
his delightful inimitable stories of Hindu and
Eurasian pleaders: he had gone too, dying at
his post like a gallant gentleman: and his
daughter, pretty Ellice Meredith, whom they all
loved, although she could not do much more
than quote 'papa'; Ellice, who had died of
fright and anguish when she heard the awful
news&mdash;these and many others, some with them,
and some taken away; but all changed. 'I
wonder,' said poor little Trixy to herself, 'if we
shall ever, ever have the heart to laugh again.'</p>

<p>She did not feel much like laughing then;
but, in the next moment, to her own great surprise,
she found herself laughing heartily. The
figure which provoked this explosion&mdash;it was
that of a tall man wrapped in a white garment,
having his forehead streaked with red and white
clay, and carrying a staff in his hand&mdash;joined
in her laugh, and then said, with some touch of
disappointment, 'I didn't think you would
know me at once.'</p>

<p>'Didn't you, Bertie?' cried the girl. 'Well,
I'm sorry I disappointed you; but I'm ridiculously
keen-sighted everyone says, and then I
know you so well. Try some one else.'</p>

<p>'I have tried the General. He was quite at
sea; thought I had come in with some wicked
intention.'</p>

<p>'But what is it for?' asked Trixy.</p>

<p>'I am going out with the faquir.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' she gasped. 'Why?'</p>

<p>'Didn't we agree that some one ought to
go?' he said.</p>

<p>'Yes; but&mdash;&mdash;' She paused to check down
her tears.</p>

<p>Bertie was looking at her strangely. He
would think her a coward, a goose. And so
she was, but she could not help herself.</p>

<p>'Go away!' she said, in a stifled voice.</p>

<p>'Go away, Trixy!'</p>

<p>'No; don't. I&mdash;I am a fool. Tell me&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>And here, to her own consternation and wrath,
she broke down completely, and began to sob
and cry like a child.</p>

<p>Bertie went closer to her. His heart, too,
was curiously soft. To see this wild, glorious,
high-spirited little creature, whose courage and
audacity he had so often admired, sobbing with
childish abandonment, was almost more than he
could bear. 'You are generally so brave,' he
said, in a choked voice. 'Why&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh; don't ask me!' she sobbed. 'Everything
has been so strange; and I was thinking
of the old days. What fun we used to have.
And&mdash;and&mdash;Bertie, you will take care of yourself?'</p>

<p>'Darling, I will try.'</p>

<p>The endearing word had sprung from him
unwittingly; but, having escaped, it could not
stand alone. He paused for a few moments to
collect himself, and then went on gravely, 'You
will say that this is no time to speak of ourselves.
I think so too; and yet, for one
moment, just for one moment&mdash;Trixy, give me
that little hand; let me hold it while I tell you
what you are to me, you bright, beautiful, brave
little creature!'</p>

<p>'Hush, Bertie! hush!' she interrupted
brokenly. 'You mustn't; you don't know me
in the least. It is you who&mdash;but I shall make
you conceited if I say any more. And,' with
a rainbow-like smile, 'we always tabooed
tu-quoques in our nursery. Come back safely,
and we shall see.'</p>

<p>'See what, Trixy?'</p>

<p>'That is for you to say, not me,' she said,
dropping a little curtsey. 'But I am better
now; and so, I hope, are you. Tell me about
Tom. Does the faquir come from him?'</p>

<p>'I think so. The man brought a letter for
your father or mother. It is only a scrap of
paper. He carried it in a quill, which he says
he could have swallowed if he had been searched.
Will you take it in?'</p>

<p>'They were both asleep when I came out,'
said Trixy, 'so I think I may venture to
read it.'</p>

<p>She opened the little roll, read the words it
contained, and gave a joyful exclamation. They
were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'I have just come back from Jhansi, with
fugitives. Nowgong has risen, but there has
been no violence; and my men are on the track
of your daughter Grace. I hope she will be
brought in to-morrow.</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Thomas Gregory</span>,</p>

<p>'Rajah of Gumilcund.'</p></blockquote>

<p>'There was another letter for our General,'
said Bertie, when Trixy had read these words
to him. 'It contained an urgent request that
some trustworthy and intelligent person should
be sent to him. He suggested this disguise, and
I got myself up in it with the help of the
faquir.'</p>

<p>'When will you start?' said Trixy, who
was trying to speak firmly.</p>

<p>'The faquir thinks we had better wait until
dusk. After we are outside it will be all right,
for our supposed sacred character will ensure
us respect. But no one must see us leaving the
station.'</p>

<p>'Then come in and breakfast with us, and
we shall see if the others recognise you.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The experiment was perfectly successful;
for when, preceding Trixy, the strange figure
of the priest appeared suddenly in the compartment
of the tent where the girls were at breakfast,
they flew away with stifled cries, and Trixy
had some little difficulty in persuading them
that he was a friend in disguise.</p>

<p>When they were all certain of one another
it was decided that neither of their invalids
should hear of the dangerous experiment until
it was over.</p>

<p>To Trixy fell the joyful task of taking in the
precious letter to her parents. She found them
better. Lady Elton had forgotten her painful
dream of the night before, and the General was
returning slowly to consciousness. In the midst
of the deep depression that weighed him down,
as the reality of what had for so many days
seemed like a vision forced itself upon his heart,
this news of Grace came like a single ray of
sunshine.</p>

<p>'If I bring you all safe out of it,' he said to
his wife, 'I shall perhaps be able to forgive
myself.'</p>

<p>Through the melancholy days which followed
Bertie's departure, this was the burden of his
cry&mdash;could he forgive himself? His wife and the
girls reasoned with him. He had not, they said,
been more deceived than others. That these
Indians were inscrutable beings the curious inconsistency
of their actions showed. One and
another came in from outside to sit with him,
and they spoke in a similar strain; but his
answer was always the same: 'If I didn't know,
I should have known. I am not fit for my post.
I will lay it down.' Still more pitiful were his
outbursts of wrath against himself for what he
called his light-hearted folly, in taking his wife
and five daughters from their quiet home, and
exposing them to the danger and horror of this
terrible time. 'I am a fool, an idiot,' he said to
one of his friends one day. 'Think of it!
Those six innocent creatures&mdash;so innocent and
helpless, that they don't know the full horror of
their situation&mdash;suffering for me, because I was
a blind, credulous fool. God in heaven! It is
almost more than a man can bear!'</p>

<p>This from the stern, self-contained man who,
only a few weeks before, had ridden boldly
through a hostile country, commanding the
respect of the fiercest enemies of his race, by
his magnificent audacity, was infinitely pitiful.</p>

<p>And meanwhile Trixy's brave little heart
fell, for there came no news from Bertie.
During the latter days of June they heard little
news of any kind at Meerut. The surrounding
country had fallen back into the state of anarchy
from which the strong hand of the British
Government had redeemed it. In all the towns
where there had been risings, the gates of the
gaols had been thrown open, and convicts, released
from their fetters, joined themselves to
men of their caste&mdash;robber tribes, who had of
late years been compelled to earn their bread by
honest toil, but who had never lost their longing
for the dear old days of rapine. These roamed
through the country, committing deeds of violence
everywhere. Turbulent spirits&mdash;dispossessed
landowners in many cases and adopted
sons of dead rajahs&mdash;went, with their followers,
from village to village, raising forced contributions
for the Holy War. With them came men
of professed sanctity, Indian faquirs and Mohammedan
moulvies, who carried firmans from the
emperor, enthroned, as they asserted, in Delhi,
and distributed, in his name, high-sounding titles
and robes of honour. There were, indeed,
moments of uneasiness amongst them. The
battle of Ghazee-ood-deen-Nugger, between
Delhi and Meerut, on the 31st of May, and
the still more notable victory at Budlee-Ka-Serai,
only five miles from the Imperial city,
showed them that the race they were defying
had life in it still. But what they lacked in
audacity they gained in numbers. The English
victories, moreover, decisive as they were for
the moment, had little permanent effect. The
army was like a swimmer in a stormy sea. As,
with force and skill, they clove one wave of
humanity, others surged up behind them innumerable,
and not the wisest could say whereto
this thing would reach. The people were
encouraged to think that it would have no end;
that from north to south, and from east to west,
the whole of the land would rise in insurrection.</p>

<p>It is difficult, however, to make any adequate
picture of what the state of India actually was
in that disastrous year. We who were in the
midst of it have forgotten, our impressions have
grown dim. Those who were not lack the sense
which would enable them to grasp it. For
security is the watchword of our modern life.
To be robbed of this&mdash;to live consciously, day
and night, on the brink of an abyss&mdash;to see the
earth open, and the subversive forces which are
for ever underlying it, break upwards in ravage
and desolating fury&mdash;to have all our softnesses
and superiorities swept away, and, in their place,
terror, nakedness and an aching sense of our own
insignificance&mdash;who of us all can fitly image it?
I cannot, I know, although I took part in it all
long ago. Yet sometimes, even now, a nightmare
vision will flash it all back again. I will
hide, breathless, in the jungle; I will listen to
the shouts of infuriated mobs that seem to be
always at my heels; I will plunge into a river,
and strike out for dear life; I will crawl on shore
at dead of night to rest my aching limbs, and
measure sadly the distance that divides me from
my friends; I will listen to tales that make the
hair of my flesh stand up with horror, and try
feebly to understand that they were our very
own&mdash;the dear women and fair children that
made the rapture of our lives&mdash;who have been
hacked and hewn, and torn limb from limb, by
fiends in human form. I will feel the blood
in my body like fire, and the strength of a
hundred will rush into my limbs, and I will
grasp my weapon and slay&mdash;slay&mdash;till my heart
is sick and my head faint; and still there will be
the same awful, insatiable thirst that nothing
can slake. And then, trembling, I will awake,
and fall down on my knees and thank the
Father of Mercies that the terror is over, and
that the greater number of those who took part
in it&mdash;Indians as well as English&mdash;are at rest.</p>

<h5><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</a></h5>

<h4>THE BREAKING OF THE MONSOON</h4>


<p>We return to Gumilcund, where Tom had been
established several days. The warmth of the
welcome he had received and the calmness and
wisdom of Chunder Singh, his counsellor, had
helped him to regain the balance of mind which
he had nearly lost in the late expedition. It was
perhaps fortunate for him that he had no time
to brood over the terrors of the hour. There
was much stir in the city, and so soon as it was
known that the rajah had come back, nothing
was done without consulting him. It gave him
a sad sort of amusement to find that he was
looked upon by many not as a sovereign alone
but as a supernaturally gifted oracle. And, in
fact, he was often surprised by his own insight.
Stranger as he was, he seemed to see instinctively
into the heart of difficulties that puzzled the
wisest heads in the city, and to propose solutions
which were only reached by other men after
arduous and prolonged thought. No doubt
this was due, in a great measure, to the study
he had given to the politics of India, and especially
to the constitution of his own state; but
it would come to him sometimes, with curious
force, that this was not all; but that another
intelligence, higher and more original than his
own, was working within him and producing
ideas of which he, Tom Gregory, the English-bred
youth, could never have dreamed in the
days that had gone by.</p>

<p>His position was a critical one, for Gumilcund
lay in the very centre of the seething mass of
insurrection that was converting the fair region
of Central India into a desert. Several of the
smaller native states were looking anxiously
towards her to see what she would do. Those
who had already cast off their allegiance sent
haughty messages, threatening untold horrors if
she did not join in the Holy War. The English
Resident, who had courageously forced his way
back to his post on the first hint of danger, used
his influence on the other side; but this, as we
have seen, was not necessary. Gumilcund had
already taken her part. In one particular Tom
was more fortunate than his loyal neighbours,
his army, owing to the wise provisions of former
rulers, being recruited from the lower and not
the higher castes. Although, therefore, as a
body of men, they were less magnificent to look
upon, they had in them a root of loyalty that
was altogether lacking in the haughty Brahmins
and proud Mohammedan warriors, who formed
the bulk of the Company's native contingent.</p>

<p>It was now proposed by the Resident that a
body of these faithful troops should be sent to
Delhi to help in the siege. On consulting
Chunder Singh and Vishnugupta, both of whom
knew the minds of the people, Tom found that
nothing would please them more than that the
army should be employed in such service.</p>

<p>Being thus satisfied, he announced his wish,
which was responded to joyfully. Throughout
the city there ran a glad tumult of expectation.
Hundreds of trained men offered themselves as
volunteers; and, out of these, a picked body
of horsemen and foot soldiers was chosen, the
command being given to a young officer of the
Kshatriya caste, who had been brought up in
the household of the late rajah.</p>

<p>Tom was overwhelmed, in the meantime,
with sorrows of his own. He thought of his
friends&mdash;the stubborn old General, of whom he
had heard as travelling through the disturbed
districts with a weak escort&mdash;sweet Lady Elton
and the girls&mdash;his companions of the tranquil
voyage in the 'Patagonia,' which seemed so long
ago; and all of them seemed to be crying out
to him to help them.</p>

<p>One effort he had made, and this, as we have
already heard, had been so far successful that
his agent, the versatile Subdul Khan, who could
be groom, snake-charmer, pedlar or holy man
at pleasure, had forced his way into Meerut and
delivered the two messages, for answers to which
Tom was now impatiently waiting.</p>

<p>He had written hopefully; but he was far
from feeling easy; and, in fact, as day after day
went by, bringing no news of Hoosanee, an
anxiety for which words have no name took
possession of him.</p>

<p>During the day-time he managed to keep up
an appearance of cheerfulness; but at night,
when everyone was shut out, and that curious
double consciousness which was at once a comfort
and a bewilderment would retire into the background
of his being, there would rise from his
tortured spirit a great and bitter cry. Grace&mdash;his
beautiful, tender darling&mdash;lovely as a vision,
pure as a saint. Grace, whom he would willingly
have shielded, if his own life were to be the forfeit&mdash;where
was she? Then, with a groan, he
would spring up and pace the marble floor of his
chamber, and fling his arms about as if he were
at war with demons, and cry out to the All
Merciful to kill him, and to let his darling live
out her sweet young life in peace.</p>

<p>It was one of these restless nights towards
the middle of June. All day long he had been
hard at work and almost unconscious of any
special pain. It had been sultry exceedingly,
the skies like molten-brass, save over the western
horizon, where leaden-coloured clouds were
gathering in battalions, and the touch of the
earth like a thrice-heated furnace. Tom, who
was so much exhausted that he thought he must
sleep, visited the little Aglaia, as was his nightly
custom, listened for a few moments to the prattle
of her and her ayah, and then retired to his
own apartment. It was in this room that the
late rajah had breathed his last; on which
account partly, and also for its space and coolness,
and the beautiful view from its low latticed
windows of the fantastic Indian garden, and the
little azure blue lake, and the low green hills
behind the city, Tom had chosen it for its own.
When he went in that night he found it dimly
lighted by heavy wax candles that stood in
sconces against the wall; the water in the marble
canal that intersected it and in the small fountain
that sprang from a basin in a recess at its upper
end murmured dreamily, and through one of the
lattices there stole in the silver rays of a young
moon. At first the space and silence had a
soothing effect upon him. He flung off the sword
which he had been carrying all day, drew his
revolver out of his belt, and threw himself down,
just as he was, on one of the thick padded
mattresses that lay on the marble floor. But he
could not sleep. The moment he laid his head
down upon his pillow the torturing thoughts
began again, and he was obliged at last to spring
from his bed, and to court the physical weariness
which might bring sleep by pacing his room
rapidly. The heat was stifling, or was it the
fever in his blood? He could not tell; but he
thought that, with all his strange experiences,
he had never felt so strange as now, and for a
few moments he forgot everything, even to the
horror that was continually haunting him, in
watching his own sensations.</p>

<p>Flames! leaping flames! Every part of his
body was enveloped in them. They rose above
his head, filling his eyes with blood; they made
the veins of his body their pathway; he saw
them before him, lying in fiery pools on the
marble pavement, so that his feet were rooted
to the ground and he dared not stir. This for
a few moments, during which he fought passionately
to regain his self-possession. Then
shutting his eyes, he made a dash for one of the
marble lattices and laid his forehead against the
hard, cold stone. It seemed to him presently
that his senses were slipping away from him&mdash;that
he was falling into a stupor or swoon; and
he must actually have lost consciousness for a
time; but how long it lasted he could not tell.
A breath of cool air, soft and tremulous as the
kiss of loving lips, aroused him; and, with a
curious sense of refreshment at his heart, he
looked out. At first he saw nothing. It was
the hollow blackness of a moonless Indian night
that smote upon his eyeballs. Then, gradually,
he began to see dim ghostly shapes moving in
slow procession across the face of the sky. He
was aware too of a curious, subdued tumult,
multitudinous whisperings, growing, now and
then, into a low shriek or wail, and with them a
rushing noise as if winged creatures innumerable
were sweeping by. With a dreamy sense of
relief, which was as incomprehensible to himself
as everything else about him, he stood gazing
and listening, and the tumult grew; shriller and
more piercing were the voices of air and sky;
the earth strained and groaned as if the invisible
forces hidden within her bosom were struggling
for freedom; a mighty wind, that swayed the
pendent branches of the banyan-tree in the court
below, and shook the withered pods of the
acacias, till they rattled like dead men's bones,
rushed through the garden.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, everything went. The
heavens vanished away in abysmal depths of
blackness. The ghostly shapes in the middle air&mdash;the
dim outline of the trees, the dusty whiteness
of the earth&mdash;all these were gone. The
monsoon had broken, and, in all the world, there
was nothing else.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>How they fall&mdash;those torrents, those sheets
of water, rushing through the air, making the
sun-baked earth hiss as they touch it&mdash;falling,
with dull, delicious splash into the lake!</p>

<p>Tom has pressed his face close to the lattice,
and put out his hands to catch the drops of
water that are running from the eaves of his
house.</p>

<p>'Now God grant there are no fugitives
abroad to-night!' he says to himself.</p>

<p>The words have scarcely escaped his lips
before a sound, more definite than those of the
tempest, strikes upon his ear. Some one down
below is knocking for admission. In the next
instant, just as he is about to go out and see who
it is, he hears a brief parley, followed by the
opening and shutting of the door that leads to
his private apartment. There follow a few
moments of suspense, and then Ganesh, the
chuprassie, who is one of the most trusted of
his servants, stands before him. Ganesh carries
a torch, by whose light Tom sees that there is a
strange glitter in his eyes.</p>

<p>'What is it?' he says. 'Who came in just
now?'</p>

<p>'Excellency,' answers Ganesh bowing low,
'Subdul Khan, his Honour's syce, has come
back.'</p>

<p>'Subdul! Thank heaven! Show him in!'
cries Tom, in great excitement.</p>

<p>'Excellency&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Do you hear me, Ganesh?'</p>

<p>'Yes, master, Ganesh hears.'</p>

<p>'Then why&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Let my master have patience! Ganesh
would speak with him before he sees the Sahib?'</p>

<p>'A Sahib&mdash;an English Sahib?'</p>

<p>'Excellency, he is in the hands of Hoossein
Buksh, who will give him all he needs. He
was wet through with the rain, and stained
with travel, and he asked for water and fresh
clothes before presenting himself to your Highness.'</p>

<p>'Right! Quite right! You have done well,
Ganesh. But where is Subdul?'</p>

<p>'He is close at hand, Excellency; but let
him wait. Ganesh, too, has a message for
your Highness.'</p>

<p>'From whom?' gasped Tom. 'Hoosanee?'</p>

<p>'No, Excellency; and yet it has to do with
the errand on which Hoosanee was sent. Had
his Highness been pleased to trust Ganesh with
his confidence, he might&mdash;but'&mdash;dropping his
voice to a still humbler tone&mdash;'I am delaying,
and your Highness, I can see, is impatient. The
message of which I have the honour to be the
bearer is from the illustrious Dost Ali Khan.'</p>

<p>'A traitor and a rebel,' said Tom, sternly.
'Do you mean to tell me that one of my servants
has been in communication with him?'</p>

<p>They were still close to the marble lattice.
The storm had increased in violence, and so
fearful was the tumult that they could scarcely
hear one another's voices. Tom moved to the
centre of the room, and, feeling almost too weak
to stand, threw himself down on one of the
mattresses.</p>

<p>'Explain yourself,' he said, as firmly as he
could. 'I would not condemn you unheard.'</p>

<p>Ganesh had followed him; he stood at the
foot of his couch, looking down upon him.</p>

<p>'Your Excellency,' he said, with that curious
dignity which generally characterises an Indian
who respects himself, 'I knew Dost Ali Khan
in the days of his greatness. Was I to forsake
him when he was poor and deserted?'</p>

<p>'Certainly not, Ganesh; but, if I am to
believe what I hear, he is poor no longer.'</p>

<p>'If your Excellency means that Dost Ali
Khan, the son of the late rajah's friend, has
raised the standard of revolt, he is right. He
has done it to recover his own. But to my
master he means well. He has not forgotten
Delhi, and his food and rest in my master's
tent.'</p>

<p>'But the message,' said Tom impatiently.</p>

<p>Ganesh hesitated a few moments, then he
opened his vest and drew out a small roll of
paper, which he placed in his master's hand,
adjusting the light so that he could read it.</p>

<p>'Is this from Dost Ali Khan?' said Tom.</p>

<p>'Let my master read what is written,'
answered the chuprassie.</p>

<p>Tom read the message, and re-read it. Then
he looked up with blazing eyes.</p>

<p>'Do you know what is in this, Ganesh?' he
said.</p>

<p>'Would Ganesh read a letter that was written
for the eyes of his master?' answered the man.</p>

<p>'That is an evasion; and I do not ask if you
have read. I ask if you know.'</p>

<p>'Where could Ganesh have seen the illustrious
Dost Ali Khan?'</p>

<p>'Another evasion. Will you&mdash;can you&mdash;answer
me directly? Do you know, or have
you any suspicion of, the contents of this letter?'</p>

<p>Thus directly appealed to, Ganesh hesitated.
He was a good servant, but he shared the
weakness of his countrymen, in that the answering
of a question with straightforward directness
was so difficult to him as almost to amount to a
physical pain.</p>

<p>'If,' he murmured, 'Ganesh has his ideas,
why should he speak of them? They may be
wrong, and then&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Wrong or right, I should like to hear them.
Come, Ganesh, if you love me, as I think you
do, answer frankly. God knows that, for the dear
sake of the woman I love, I would willingly
encounter any danger; but if it were useless,
if I were to thrust my feet into a cunningly laid
trap without helping her, of what good would
that be to any of us? Answer me, you who know
the man who wrote this letter. Is it a trap?'</p>

<p>'Master,' cried Ganesh, forgetting his caution.
'I beseech you to take the word of your servant.
It is no trap. If it had been, does his Excellency
think that Ganesh would have brought
the message hither? Dost Ali Khan has not
forgotten my master's kindness to him in the
hour of his need&mdash;how he saved his life, and fed
him, and gave him shelter, and comfortable
words. Of this I am certain. Further, I know
not.'</p>

<p>'But if you know so much, you must know
more.'</p>

<p>Still more deeply Ganesh bowed his head,
but he did not speak.</p>

<p>'Do you mean to say more?' asked his
master.</p>

<p>'Excellency&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'The time is passing. I must see Subdul
and the English Sahib before the morning. Do
you, or do you not?'</p>

<p>'If my master will deign to tell his
servant&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'No, Ganesh, I will tell you nothing. You
must be frank with me before I can be frank
with you. This, besides, is sudden. I must
think and take counsel. You cannot speak, then
leave me. Call Subdul, and let Hoossein Buksh
tell the Sahib that I am ready to speak with
him.'</p>

<p>There was no disputing this command. With
a lingering look of perplexity and disappointment
Ganesh left the room. A few minutes
later, while Tom was still puzzling over the
strange script, and wondering if any dependence
was to be placed upon it, Subdul Khan, dressed
in his faquir's disguise, stood before him.</p>

<p>He sprang up. 'You have succeeded, then?'
he said eagerly.</p>

<p>'Yes, Excellency,' said Subdul, whose dark
face was glowing with pleasure. 'I gave up
your Highness's letters; and the Sahib who has
come back with me brings word from his lords.
We carried no letters, for there were two of us,
and the task was so much the greater. But the
face of the Sahib will be known to his Excellency,
and he will be able to trust his word.'</p>

<p>'I would trust no one more than you,
Subdul,' said Tom affectionately. 'My own
brother&mdash;the son of my mother&mdash;could not have
stood by me more truly than you have done.
What would you have to mark my gratitude&mdash;gold,
jewels, a robe of honour?'</p>

<p>'I would have nothing, Excellency, until
these troubles are over,' said Subdul. 'For my
master to call me brother is more than sufficient
reward. And here comes the Sahib. Shall
Subdul leave?'</p>

<p>'No. Stay where you are. You have earned
a right to our fullest confidence. Have you
eaten?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Excellency. While my master was
talking with Ganesh food was brought to
me.'</p>

<p>'Then sit down and rest,' said Tom, pointing
to a pile of cushions close by.</p>

<p>Subdul obeyed deprecatingly, though as a
fact his limbs, which had been in strong exercise
for many hours, were nearly giving way under
him from fatigue. Then, once more, the purdah
before the door was lifted, and Bertie Liston,
shaved and washed, and dressed in the whitest
of English linen, and the most artistically built
of Tom's English suits, which fitted him almost
to perfection, came in. The contrast between this
trim English gentleman and his present surroundings
was so fantastic a thing that, excited and
unstrung as he was, Tom could scarcely help
laughing. As for Bertie, he made no bones
about it; he laughed outright. Poor fellow!
he was to hear in a few moments what would
make him feel, like Trixy, that he would never
be able to laugh again. He apologised, in the
meantime, in his airy and graceful fashion.</p>

<p>'Excuse me, Mr. Gregory; but really this
is&mdash;well&mdash;like a chapter out of Haroun El
Raschid, or the other fellow, don't you know.
You are Mr. Gregory, I suppose. Couldn't that
good fellow, Subdul, give us a little more light
on the subject? Ah! thanks,' as a pair of
heavy gold candlesticks were placed on the
table at Tom's elbow. 'Now we can see one
another, and I begin to recognise you. We met
at Meerut, if you remember, in the spring.
Capital dance you gave, by-the-bye. Different
sort of meeting this.'</p>

<p>'But a good meeting all the same,' said Tom,
wringing Bertie's hand. 'And you look just as
you did then. Sit down. Have they given you
supper?'</p>

<p>'Enough to go on upon,' answered Bertie,
laughing. 'A magnificent meal of some kind
is being prepared outside. You are a regular
Monte Cristo, old fellow.'</p>

<p>'Then if you can wait, and are able to talk,
tell me for heaven's sake how they all are&mdash;the
dear old General and Lady Elton and the girls.'</p>

<p>'They are pretty well, thank you. It was
hoped, when we left, that General Elton had
taken a turn for the better.'</p>

<p>'Has he been ill, then?' asked Tom.</p>

<p>'Ill? He has been at death's door. Haven't
you heard of what he did?'</p>

<p>'I heard that he was travelling through the
country with a small escort.'</p>

<p>'Yes, actually, after the mutiny at Meerut,
when the troops were going off, regiment after
regiment, like so many fire-rockets. I should
think such a feat was never done before&mdash;rode
through the most disturbed districts with only
about fifty men, and not a soul molested him
until he was close to Meerut.'</p>

<p>Here Bertie gave a dramatic account of the
ambush near Meerut, and of how, by his pluck
and resource, the General had extricated himself
from it.</p>

<p>'What a grand old fellow he is!' said Tom,
who had been listening with the deepest interest.
'And he is better?'</p>

<p>'We hope so, physically at least; but his
mind is, for the present, curiously astray. I am
sometimes afraid that it is a case of heart-break.
He can't get over the treachery of the troops,
especially of his own pet regiment, and he can't
forgive himself for bringing his people over. If
he knew for certain that his eldest daughter was
safe I think it would go far towards restoring
him.'</p>

<p>'Ah!' groaned Tom, 'that is just it. If any
of us knew!'</p>

<p>'I thought you wrote&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What I wrote was true then. I had reason
to believe that I had a clue, but I lost it again.
I should tell you that I have been in constant
communication with Nowgong for some time.
One of the most trusted of my servants went
there several weeks ago. We were certain the
detachment there would rise, and I offered an
asylum to all the ladies. The officers refused,
and we tried to persuade Miss Elton to come
away with her cousin and another lady, but she
declined. In all the station there was the most
insane confidence in the native troops. Seeing
I could do nothing personally, I sent my servant
to watch, and stationed men of my own in the
neighbouring villages. I started for Jhansi,
hoping to gain the protection of the Ranee for
our poor friends there. But I was taken by
a troop of Dost Ali Khan's soldiers, and kept
prisoner for three days. When I got away it
was too late.'</p>

<p>'What?' gasped Bertie, who had not yet
heard these awful news. 'You don't mean to say
that they were&mdash;&mdash;?' He could not finish.</p>

<p>'Massacred, every one of them, except a
little child whom I saved and brought back with
me,' said Tom very sadly.</p>

<p>Bertie groaned. 'I had friends there,' he
faltered. 'Poor devils! Well&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'It was a swift death,' said Tom. 'They gave
themselves up, as they had no food, and they
were brought out together. The horror was
soon over. I saw them lying out under the
stars.'</p>

<p>'For the vultures and jackals to feed upon!
God! God! Do you think there is a God, for
I don't. Could He&mdash;would He&mdash;&mdash;?' The
poor boy, for he was little more, sank down and
covered his face with his hands. When he
looked up his eyes were bloodshot, and his
face was ghastly pale. 'I had a sister there,'
he whispered, 'lately married. She was&mdash;but
what's the use of talking? A baby, too,
a few months old. I went to see them in the
winter, and the little rascal held out his fist for
my sword. We said he was to be a soldier.
Here'&mdash;leaping up&mdash;'let me go out of this. I
can't stand it. I must punish the brutes,
or&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You will, all in good time,' said Tom; 'but
you must wait. We must all wait. Sit down
and try to be reasonable. Remember the
living.'</p>

<p>'Have we any right to be living&mdash;we men?
Great heavens! The tender, the helpless, the
innocent! No one to defend them. If I had
only been there!'</p>

<p>'You could have done nothing,' said Tom
sadly.</p>

<p>'Couldn't I? Who knows? At least I
could have killed some of them. Oh God! Oh
God! It will kill me.'</p>

<p>There was a pause. Bertie was sobbing like
a child. Tom sat where he was, gazing out
before him&mdash;his eyes hot and dry. He, too,
would have wept, but he could not. The
anguish of suspense, which is even more terrible
than the horror of certainty, was working
within him, and the solace of tears would not
come.</p>

<p>After a few moments Bertie lifted his head.
'You will think me a poor weak fool,' he said
feebly, 'but, by heaven, who could help it? I
heard of them only a few weeks ago. They
were pitying us, and feeling confident about
themselves. The good Ranee would take care
of them. Had she a hand in it?'</p>

<p>'I dare not say,' answered Tom. 'All I
know is that she had herself proclaimed as an
independent ruler, so she has at least consented
to it. But why talk about what is over? We
have something to do in the present, you and I.
Here in Gumilcund we are staunch, thank God!
and our object is one. We are weaving a net
about the feet of these murderers of women and
children, and you must help us. That was my
reason for sending to Meerut. Now at last I
hope the English Government will find out who
its true friends are. In the meantime, Captain
Liston, we must forget our private vengeance.
It will be swallowed up in the larger. Are you
listening to me?'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes. Only tell me what to do and I
will do it.'</p>

<p>There followed a conversation, into the details
of which it is not necessary to enter here, for the
daring plans which it initiated, and which were
afterwards adopted by the English rulers in this
region of India, form part of the general history
of the war.</p>

<p>When morning broke over the storm-swept
country they left Tom's sleeping-room and went
out into the banqueting-hall, where a fine repast
had been spread out by the rajah's servants.</p>

<p>In the course of the morning they parted.
Bertie, accompanied as before by Subdul Khan,
went back to Meerut to lay Tom's sagacious proposals
before the General in command there,
while the rajah rode in state to the principal
gate of the city to bid farewell to the gallant
little army that was setting out for Delhi.</p>

<h5><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</a></h5>

<h4>A LITTLE BAND OF FUGITIVES</h4>


<p>We must now turn aside for a few moments to
relate as nearly as we can the experiences of a
little band of fugitives who, late that evening,
crossed the boundaries of Gumilcund. It was
pitifully small, consisting of three ladies and one
little child. For ten long days and nights these
had been upon the road. Through the day they
had lived huddled together in filthy huts and
cattle byres, doing nothing, trembling at every
sound, and passionately wishing the long hours
away. At night, when the sun had gone down,
and the brief twilight of the Indian evening had
faded, the mysterious native guide, who from
the beginning had stood by them, nobly risking
his own life more than once in their defence,
would come and lead them out to where an
ekka or native cart drawn by two small bullocks
would be in waiting, and while darkness lasted
they would toil on.</p>

<p>It was a dreary journey, full of hardships
and sickening anxiety, but, for the most part,
uneventful; and as day followed day and night
night, bringing no change, some of the poor
creatures began to feel as if there was to be no
end, as if they were destined so to go on for
ever. Had they known what others were going
through at that very time they might have been
more reconciled to their own hard lot. For
their strange guide was curiously regardful of
their comfort. Every day and every night he
brought them as good food as he could procure,
with fresh warm water to wash in, and such
fruit as could be found in the markets, neither
asking nor accepting payment, while in every
possible way he consulted their convenience.
What his motive could be it was difficult to
imagine. One of the ladies may have had some
idea, but she chose to be mysterious. Nevertheless
her confidence, which was apparent from
the first, gave confidence to the others, all of
whom had followed her lead when they decided
to trust this man. They were beginning, in fact,
to live down their fears, and to believe that he
did really mean well towards them, when their
confidence was shaken by the awful occurrence
which I must relate.</p>

<p>They had been travelling for nine days, and
they were now only one day's journey from
their place of rest. This their guide, whose
face became more radiant as they advanced,
assured them one morning. A day of confinement,
a night's jolting over the rough country
ways, and their trials would be over.</p>

<p>On the night that followed this announcement
they set forth upon their journey with
lighter hearts than usual. The guide pressed
their pace. For two days past storms had been
threatening, and he was anxious to get in before
the breaking of the monsoon season. He was
not, however, very uneasy, for there were now
no formidable streams between them and their
goal, and the stout covering of the cart would
protect the ladies from the worst of the rain.</p>

<p>The awful blackness, which precedes a storm
in India, fell upon the little party two or three
hours after they had started. There were then
in the ekka four ladies and two children. The
guide, who was walking at the bullocks' heads,
stopped them for a moment to draw down the
curtains of the cart, when one of the ladies said
she would faint if she were kept so close, and
another begged to be allowed to get down and
walk beside the bullocks. The guide demurred;
but the darkness was so great, and the place
seemed so solitary, that he was easily persuaded
to give way to her wish. She alighted, and the
elder of the two children, in spite of the earnest
entreaties of his mother, not, however, reinforced
by the other ladies, who were rather
glad to be rid of him for a few moments,
followed her.</p>

<p>This change gave a little comfort in the
cart, which went on quietly for some time, the
lady outside holding the guide's girdle to help
herself along, and the little boy clinging to her
skirts.</p>

<p>The road along which they were moving
was bounded by woods that made walls of
blackness on the right hand and on the left.
The sky was entirely covered. There was not
a ray of light anywhere; but the guide, who
knew the road well, had not the least fear. He
was, in fact, congratulating himself on the
darkness, which made a refuge for them, when
suddenly his heart was paralysed by a sound
of terrible significance. Even the poor beasts
shivered as it rang through the woods. 'Deen!
Deen!' It came from the right hand and from
the left, filling the black spaces with its echoes.
'Deen! Deen!' It was the Mussulman battle-cry,
and it was coming nearer&mdash;nearer, enveloping
them, floating towards them on the wind.</p>

<p>A stifled scream came from those within the
ekka. 'Silence, in heaven's name!' hissed the
guide. 'The darkness is our only hope.'</p>

<p>Then to the lady, who stood erect by his
side: 'Missy Grace, it is all over with them.
The sepoys have lights. They will see the cart.
But for you and the child there is yet a chance.
Stand where you are!'</p>

<p>She obeyed him without a sound. He felt
about on hands and knees and then came back
to her. 'There is a nullah close by,' he
whispered; 'hide!'</p>

<p>Scarcely knowing what she did, but hoping
against hope that she might save her darling
Kit, Grace, following the directions of the guide,
leapt into a shallow ditch, and drew the long
grass over herself and the child. 'If they let
me live, I will come back to you,' he whispered;
'if not, go on straight to the next village and
say that Hoosanee, the servant of the Rajah of
Gumilcund, has sent you to his father. He will
guard you till you reach the city. Farewell,
noble lady!' And he returned to the cart. In
the next moment Grace saw the flashing of
torches and heard the trampling of armed men
in the woods. Kit began to whimper. She
breathed in his ear that, if he wished to see his
mother again, he must be brave and good, and
pressed him close against her breast to stifle his
sobs. Then, with a strange composure at her
heart, a feeling that the worst&mdash;the awful thing
to which they had been looking forward so
long&mdash;had come, she lifted herself up on hands
and knees and looked out over the edge of the
nullah.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Armed to the teeth, some of them riding,
and others on foot carrying torches, the sepoys
came pouring out of the wood. The light fell
on the cart, and, with cries like those of wild
creatures scenting their prey, they gathered
round it. A man taller and better dressed than
the others imposed silence by an authoritative
word, and with a sweep of his naked tulwar
thrust them back, so that they made a wide
circle, having the cart in the midst of them.</p>

<p>The curtains were down, not a sound proceeded
from within them, and the gallant guide
kept his place at the bullocks' heads.</p>

<p>Her heart throbbing with admiration and
terror, Grace watched him from her hiding-place.
She heard his voice, clear and strong,
as he addressed the leader: 'We are peaceful
travellers. What do you want with us?'</p>

<p>'Draw open the curtains of that cart,' was
the brutal answer. 'You have Feringhees
there.'</p>

<p>'<i>You</i> may sin, for you have the power,' said
the guide boldly. '<i>I</i> dare not.'</p>

<p>'Do you deny that they are Feringhees?'</p>

<p>'They are holy women, bound under a
vow to travel by night to the sacred river.
Touch them and you incur the guilt of sacrilege!'</p>

<p>The leader laughed out loudly. 'Tell a
better tale next time, son of an ass,' he said
scornfully. 'We will run the risk and see the
colour of their faces for ourselves!'</p>

<p>Upon this the unhappy guide began to dance
wildly round the cart. 'Let my lord have
pity!' he cried out. 'Feringhees or not, they
are women and children who have done no
wrong&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>He was not allowed to finish. The leader
pushed him aside, and, amid the jeers of his
men, began to feel along the sides of the cart.
At his touch the ladies screamed, sprang out,
and fell on their knees.</p>

<p>How the poor girl in the nullah preserved
her senses, how she kept back the scream that
was clutching at her throat, she never knew.
Grace, palpitating with horror, grasping with
her one hand at the sides of the nullah, and
with the other pressing Kit's face to her bosom,
so that he could neither cry out nor see, she
stood, yet never for one moment did she lose
her presence of mind.</p>

<p>Her friends rose, ran a few paces, saw by
the flare of the torches that they were surrounded,
and then knelt again, and implored
piteously for mercy. For a few moments no
one stirred. Then the voice of the leader broke
the silence. 'I want one of you. The rest may
go on their way in peace.'</p>

<p>Here the guide interposed with a shrill cry:
'What my lord wishes is impossible. We go
on together or not at all.'</p>

<p>'Be silent! Who spoke to you?' said the
leader.</p>

<p>'Excellency, for the love of the Prophet&mdash;by
your hopes of Paradise, listen to me!'</p>

<p>'Do you hear?' roared the leader, making a
dash at the poor man with his sword. 'Silence!
I have to put a question to these mem-sahibs.
If they answer it truly they are free.
The daughter of that son of Satan, who calls
himself the General Elton, is here. I am sent
to take her prisoner. Let her give herself up
and the rest are free!'</p>

<p>In the little group of trembling women there
was neither sound nor stir; but their guide
sprang forward.</p>

<p>'She is not here,' he cried.</p>

<p>'You lie, infidel!'</p>

<p>'Nay, by the Prophet's beard. I speak the
truth! To satisfy you, I will give you the names
of those here. Let them go on in peace, and&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>The leader broke in with an awful imprecation.</p>

<p>'That is enough,' he cried. 'If she has escaped
me, all these shall die.'</p>

<p>He advanced threateningly. Even as he did
so there came from close at hand a voice, so
clear and still that it seemed to be ringing down
from the upper air. 'They shall not die,' it said,
'I am here.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was like a vision. Hoosanee told his
master so, when, sobbing like a child, he gave
him an account of his stewardship. Pale as
death; but, moving proudly like a queen, her
head thrown back, her eyes burning under their
lids; she stood suddenly amongst them&mdash;the
young English girl who knew how to die.</p>

<p>'I am here,' she said firmly. 'Let me speak
a word to the kind friend who has helped me so
far, and then, if you have really any pity, kill
me.'</p>

<p>A moment of silence followed her bold words.
No one cried out. No hand was raised to touch
her. Her heroism, it would almost seem, had
touched some chord of gentleness even in these
wild hearts.</p>

<p>She moved forward quietly towards her
terror-stricken countrywomen, and whispered
in English that they should get into the cart
again. 'Kit is close by,' she said. 'You will
find him when these men have gone. I have
persuaded him to keep quiet.' Then, in a lower
tone, 'I will tell you for your comfort what I
was afraid to tell you before. You are going
to an Englishman&mdash;a dear friend of mine. Give
him my love, and tell him that I thank him for
what he has done, and that I thought of him
even to the last. Get in, dears. Cover yourselves
up. Now kiss me, and good-bye.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Grace! Grace! Why did you do it?'
sobbed one. 'We can't go on without you, and
we could all have died.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said the girl, with strange solemnity,
'we can all die. Thank God for that! Lucy,
you know what I have here&mdash;something swift
and sudden. Tell them at home and give them
my dear love.'</p>

<p>'But we can't leave you so,' sobbed Lucy.</p>

<p>'You must! Get in, Lucy. Yes, if you love
me. Would you kill all of them?'</p>

<p>In the meantime the unhappy Hoosanee had
prostrated himself at the feet of the leader, and
was pouring out entreaties and denials. 'She
lies, Excellency. Do not listen to her. It is to
save the others that she has spoken. She is not
the child of the General. She is the sister of
my master, the Rajah of Gumilcund, whose servant
I am. Let her go on with us, and we will
bless you all the days of our life.'</p>

<p>So and with many more words he pleaded,
but they took no more notice of his entreaties
than of the blowing of the wind among the trees.</p>

<p>Then Grace, who had bade good-bye to her
people, came forward again, and touched him
on the arm.</p>

<p>'It is useless, my poor Hoosanee,' she said.
'They are stronger than we are. I must go with
them, and you will, for my sake, take my poor
friends on. Remember Kit.'</p>

<p>At this moment there was a wild shriek,
which made Grace wring her hands and weep.
'Oh, God! have pity!' she moaned. 'Is it not
enough? That is his voice; I left him insensible.'</p>

<p>Maddened with terror at finding himself
alone, the poor child had sprung out of the
nullah, and made blindly for where the torches
were shining. A sepoy seized him. Grace cried
out frantically and covered her face with her
hands. The poor women in the cart, who thought
that it was her death-cry, gave a piteous wail.
Hoosanee dashed forward and seized the barbarian's
arm. 'Shame! shame!' he cried, 'it
is a girl-child; give it to me!'</p>

<p>The light of the torches flashed on poor little
Kit's long golden curls and delicate face, and
there was a murmur of pity. The child was
released, and he dashed headlong into Grace's
arms. 'Go to Hoosanee, darling!' she whispered.
'He will take you to your mother.'</p>

<p>'No, no, no. I'll go with you. Take me!
take me!' sobbed poor little Kit, the strain of
his arms tightening.</p>

<p>'No, Kit, no; I can't. Oh God! It will kill
me! Hoosanee, take him. Take him by force
if you must. There! there!'</p>

<p>'Enough! Take them both,' cried the leader.
A litter had been brought out. It was put down,
and Grace was ordered to get into it. She made
one last effort to send away Kit; but he clung
to her more convulsively than ever. They got
in together; the curtains were lowered; four
stout coolies lifted the pole to their shoulders; a
body of torch-bearers ranged themselves on
either side; the horsemen and foot soldiers made
a compact mass round them; and, in a few
moments, they were being swung along at a swift
pace&mdash;going they knew not whither.</p>

<p>Then Grace burst into tears, and Kit loosened
his frantic grasp of her neck. 'Why did you
come, child?' she said. 'You would have been
safe with them. To-morrow they will be in
Gumilcund.'</p>

<p>'But I'd much rather be with you,' said Kit,
'and it would be beastly cowardly to let you
go alone. Don't cry, Grace. I'll take care of
you now.'</p>

<h5><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX</a></h5>

<h4>THE WELCOME OF A SORROWFUL SPIRIT</h4>


<p>The rajah had returned from seeing off his troops,
and he and Chunder Singh were shut up together
in close conclave. For the first time since
fate had so strangely thrown them together they
had been having a serious difference of opinion.
The subject that divided them was the written
message which the rajah had received from Dost
Ali Khan, and which ran as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>'To-morrow the Englishwoman you seek will
be in my hands. Come to me for her. Ganesh
will show you the way.'</p></blockquote>

<p>After serious thought, Tom had come to the
conclusion that it would be wise at once to obey
this summons&mdash;a conclusion justified no doubt
by the knowledge that rest and peace of mind
would be perfectly impossible to him until he
had tested its truth. Chunder Singh, on the
other hand, who suspected a trap&mdash;he knew that
Dost Ali Khan was anxious to separate Gumilcund
from the English alliance&mdash;wished him not
to act precipitately, but to endeavour, before
putting himself in the power of so desperate a
rebel, to find out what had actually been done
by Hoosanee for the Nowgong fugitives.</p>

<p>The discussion waxed warm, and both men
grew irritated. Tom insisted on starting at once.
Chunder Singh used the most cogent arguments
to stop him. Tom tore the arguments to shreds
and tatters. Chunder Singh produced others,
of an even more telling character, which, in their
turn, were demolished by the ardent youth. At
last Chunder Singh showed mutinous symptoms.
He couched his resistance, indeed, in the most
decorous language, being as prodigal as usual of
submissive words and high-sounding titles, but
beneath the velvet glove the iron hand was
hidden. The rajah was made to understand
that, having accepted the raj, he belonged to the
people over whom he ruled, and that they would
protect him, even against himself, if such a step
was necessary. His late expedition had caused
much murmuring. Having received him back
in safety from the very jaws of death, the people
did not feel disposed to allow him to risk his life
again. He, Chunder Singh, would, in such case,
be called to account. He besought his master,
for all these reasons, to be patient, hinting pretty
broadly that impatience would serve no good
purpose, since he would not be allowed to
thrust his head into any robber's den, even for
the sake of a charming young lady.</p>

<p>This was expressed with so much deference,
and brought out in such a roundabout manner,
that it was some time before its actual significance
dawned upon Tom. When he did understand
his wrath was extreme. Forgetting, for a
moment, the Oriental manners, in which he had
taken such pains to perfect himself, he stormed
at his Indian counsellor in the good old English
fashion. What did the fellow take him for&mdash;a
fool, or an idiot? Did he really suppose that
he would allow himself to be dictated to? He
strongly advised him to keep for the future to
his own department, and to understand that, as
far as his personal action was concerned, he intended
to keep a free hand. He would exercise
his own judgment with regard to his movements,
and come and go at his own pleasure, without
deigning to consult any of them. To all this
Chunder Singh listened with an unmoved countenance.
His face was a mask, behind which his
irritated young master tried in vain to look. If
he was surprised, if he was angry, if he was
determined, it was not possible to say. They
had reached this point&mdash;an uncomfortable sort
of deadlock&mdash;when Tom heard light, flying footsteps
in the corridor, and, looking out, saw his
little friend, Aglaia, running breathless towards
his room.</p>

<p>'What is it, darling?' he said. 'Do you
want me?'</p>

<p>She ran into his arms. 'Ganesh says
they are coming,' she cried, 'and ayah wants
me to go to bed. Mayn't I stay up to see
them?'</p>

<p>'Who are coming, dear? What does Ganesh
say?'</p>

<p>Ganesh was close behind her. 'Excellency,'
he said, bowing low, 'a runner has come in
with news from Hoosanee, his Honour's servant.'</p>

<p>'Well! well! go on, for heaven's sake!'</p>

<p>'He has already entered the city. He brings
with him some of the English sahib-log from
Nowgong.'</p>

<p>'From Nowgong! Thank God! Chunder
Singh, do you hear? They have come in. Now
we can lie down in peace and sleep. Ganesh&mdash;why
do you look at me so? Hoosanee, you
said, from Nowgong?'</p>

<p>'Hoosanee, Excellency. He has come back
safely.'</p>

<p>'And where are they?'</p>

<p>'The mem-sahibs are in a cart which travels
slowly. The runner left them within the gate
of the Princes. He came at his full speed.'</p>

<p>'Have Snow-queen saddled at once, and I
will ride out to meet them. No, my little
Aglaia, I cannot take you. It is too late, and
the air is heavy after yesterday's storm. They
must have been out in it, Chunder. Help him
to have everything ready, Aglaia. Supper and
sleeping rooms, and fresh garments. Thank
heaven that I took your advice, my good friend!
You always advise me well. Is Snow-queen
ready, Ganesh?'</p>

<p>'The syces are bringing her round, Excellency.
But&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Then don't stop me. I will listen to what
you have to say presently.'</p>

<p>With a light and swinging step, as of one
from whose mind a heavy burden has been
taken, the young rajah walked along the corridor,
and ran down the marble steps that led to
the inner court of the palace. The night was as
dark as pitch; but torch-bearers were running
by the side of the horse, which had been saddled
and was now being brought at a quick trot
across the paved court.</p>

<p>In a moment Tom was in his saddle.</p>

<p>Chunder Singh, who had been speaking to
Ganesh, sprang forward. 'Excellency,' he
said, in English. 'Listen to one word before
you go.'</p>

<p>'Let it be short, then, Chunder. Snow-queen
is as impatient as I am. See how
she is trembling,' and, he added under his
breath, '<i>she</i> shall ride you to-morrow, little
beauty!'</p>

<p>Chunder Singh, meantime, was faltering out
his dreary warning, begging him not to set his
hopes too high, but to prepare for disappointment.</p>

<p>Disappointment! He laughed out merrily.
He would not even answer the well-meant, but
foolish, words. He shook his bridle-rein, and
touched Snow-queen with his heel, and in a
moment she was carrying him at a quick trot
through the arched gateway and out into the
beautiful market-place, which to-night was empty
of people. The runners, carrying torches, ran
before them. The night air, heavily scented
with the breath of moist foliage and faded
blossoms, swept by. He was madly, fiercely,
happy. This dark night-world was as a Paradise,
in which his trembling heart was uplifted
till it moved in a heaven of bliss for which
words have no name. All his fine schemes, all
his lofty aspirations, with the curious mysticism
which had become almost a part of his being&mdash;where
were they? Gone, as the vapours of
morning go when the full radiance of the day
has come.</p>

<p>Disappointment! What fool's tongue spoke
that word of ill-omen? Hoosanee had come
back&mdash;Hoosanee, who knew, who had read, the
secret of his heart&mdash;and Hoosanee had brought
back fugitives. That she was not amongst them
would be impossible.</p>

<p>So terrible, so overpowering, was his joy,
that there were moments of that frantic ride
when he felt as if he could not bear it&mdash;as if it
would kill him. Once, to the great solace of his
light-carriers, who, stalwart and swift as they
were, could scarcely keep up with him, he drew
rein for a moment, and pressed his hand to his
heart, whose wild, passionate throbs seemed to
be choking out his life. A few moments&mdash;a few
moments&mdash;and then&mdash;ah! there they are&mdash;a
little covered cart, stealing slowly down the
road&mdash;men carrying lanterns beside it&mdash;the
guide, his noble Hoosanee, walking at the
bullocks' heads! Now, what an idiot he has been
not to order out carriages! She&mdash;they&mdash;should
not thus make their entry into his palace. But
it is dark now, thank heaven! and storms are
threatening, and no one is abroad. To-morrow,
when they are rested and refreshed, and clothed
in fine raiment&mdash;to-morrow they will drive in
state through his city.</p>

<p>But surely Hoosanee has seen him&mdash;why
does he not hasten forward? And he is hanging
his head, like one ashamed&mdash;he who has done
this great and noble deed. What does it mean?</p>

<p>He spurs on. The cart stops, and Hoosanee
approaches him, bowing low.</p>

<p>'Is all well&mdash;is all well, Hoosanee?' cries
the poor fellow.</p>

<p>'Excellency, your servant has done what he
could.'</p>

<p>'I know it; but&mdash;my good fellow, don't
torture me. She is safe?'</p>

<p>'Sahib, she is in the hands of the All-Merciful.'</p>

<p>'Dead?'</p>

<p>'Excellency, in a few moments I will tell
you all. There are three English ladies and a
little child in the cart. They are fainting with
hunger and weariness. Will not your Honour
speak to them?'</p>

<p>For a moment Tom's head sank upon his
breast. He could not. Then, making a fierce
effort to recover himself, he dismounted, threw
his reins to one of the syces and went up to the
cart.</p>

<p>A wild white face, set round with an aureole
of yellow hair, looked out at him. It was
Lucy's.</p>

<p>'Oh!' she wailed. 'Where are we, and
why are we stopping? Is this the end?'</p>

<p>'It will be the end of your troubles, I hope,
dearest lady,' said Tom very gently.</p>

<p>'An English voice,' cried another lady hysterically.
'Thank God!'</p>

<p>'An English voice, and an English heart,'
said the young rajah. 'I am taking you to my
house, dear ladies. Command me as if I were
your brother.'</p>

<p>He tried to go on, but he could not. The
words choked him, and his heart was like to
burst. Motioning to Hoosanee to take the cart
on, he fell back behind it. As he went he heard
the ladies' voices. They were speaking joyfully
one to the other, congratulating themselves on
their escape. Hungrily he listened, hoping still
against hope that he might have misinterpreted
Hoosanee. He heard two voices&mdash;then a third,
much weaker than the other two, and, now and
again, piercing his heart to a pity that almost
slew him, the feeble wailing of a little child;
but that voice, for the least of whose vibrations
he would have given his life, he heard not. And
so, with a dull heart that had yet to realise the
fullness of its woe, he plodded on.</p>

<p>The syce brought up Snow-queen, but he
refused to mount her. The mechanical movement,
the contact with the dull earth, seemed
fittest for him; now and then it would be to
him even as if he were walking in a funeral
procession&mdash;as if his youth, and all the hope and
gladness of his life, were being carried out to be
buried under fathoms of earth.</p>

<p>In the palace Chunder Singh and Aglaia had
been busy, and everything was ready for the
reception of the ladies. Ah! how delightful it
was to the tired wanderers&mdash;all the little luxuries
to which they were accustomed, the deep baths
filled with warm scented waters, and the daintily
spread meal, and the soft couches on which presently
they would rest their weary limbs, above
all, the tender, the reverential welcome. There
was a solemnity&mdash;a sadness&mdash;about it that
touched them curiously. But none of them
knew what it had cost their entertainer to step
forward as he did, and to hand them out of the
cart, and to speak those kind words of sympathy
and welcome.</p>

<p>'I am thankful to God,' he said earnestly,
'that you have found your way to me. You are
safe here, for we are prepared for any number of
enemies. Do me the favour of treating my house
as if it was your own.'</p>

<p>'Oh, thank you! thank you!' they cried in
one breath. But poor little Lucy, when the
hand of the rajah touched hers, broke into a
torrent of tears. 'Can nothing be done for
Grace?' she wailed.</p>

<p>'Is she alive?' said the rajah.</p>

<p>'Yes! Yes! Oh! she was carried away, and
we let her go&mdash;she, who had done so much for
us! I shall never forgive myself that I did not
go with her. Couldn't I go now&mdash;couldn't some
one?'</p>

<p>'I will see Hoosanee. I will try,' said
Tom chokingly. 'I think&mdash;but forgive me,
I can't talk now, and you must rest. My
people&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>From the corridor above a child's laugh rang
out. Kit's mother, who was one of the little
company, so reduced in strength now that she
could scarcely speak, gave a little stifled cry,
staggered forward, and would have fallen had
not Tom caught her in time. 'How foolish I
am!' she murmured. 'I thought it was Kit.'</p>

<p>'Your child,' said Tom tenderly, as, thinking
of his own mother, he took her up in his strong
young arms.</p>

<p>'Yes, my little Kit,' she moaned. 'They
took him away. They were going to kill him;
but they saw his beautiful curls, and they
thought he was a girl. I beg your pardon for
being so foolish. I think I can walk.'</p>

<p>But he saw that she was weaker than she
thought, and he would not put her down until
she was in the hands of Aglaia and her ayah.</p>

<p>Then he left them all to rest, sent a message
to the Resident to let him know that they had
arrived safely, and, at last, when he was sure
that everything which hospitality demanded had
been done, he sent for Hoosanee.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h5><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX</a></h5>

<h4>CHUNDER SINGH'S PRECAUTIONS</h4>


<p>'Tell me everything,' said the rajah.</p>

<p>'I will try,' replied the poor fellow; 'but my
master must not blame me more than he can
help. I acted for the best.'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes; but&mdash;oh! Hoosanee, my servant,
my friend,' cried Tom, breaking down now at
last, and for a few moments giving way to his
passionate grief. 'It is too terrible,' he went on,
when the strangled sobs and the shivering of his
limbs would let him speak. 'God knows I am
glad to have rescued them; but I never thought&mdash;I
never imagined&mdash;that you, knowing my
heart as you do, would bring back the others
and not her. How could it have been?'</p>

<p>Then Hoosanee told rapidly the story that
we know.</p>

<p>'It was herself, master,' he cried. 'As your
Honour lives, she was safe. They would not
have found her, for the night was as dark as the
jaws of hell, and to save the others I could have
made a story, and the ladies would have helped
me. We would have said that she was dead. I
would have taken them on to my father's village
and returned, when all was still, for her and the
child. We should all&mdash;all have come in; but
she is a daughter of Allah&mdash;too fine&mdash;too noble
even to be paralysed by fear. When she heard
the Soubahdar use threatening words she came
out and they carried her away. I ask my
master what could I do?'</p>

<p>'Nothing. You have done your best, my
poor Hoosanee. And now it rests with me.'</p>

<p>'Not so, master. You cannot go out as I
have done. You know neither the people nor
their ways. If you can think who has taken
her, tell me, and I will at least find out if she
is alive and what treatment she is receiving.
Master'&mdash;piteously&mdash;'do not deny me! It is
not for your Excellency's sake alone, although
to serve you is dear to me. It is for her. Ah!
master, if you had seen her through all those
nights. <i>They</i> were impatient; they would
blame me sometimes, and say that I had not
done my best; and sometimes, master, knowing a
little English as I do, I could hear that they
were angry with one another and the child.
But <i>she</i> was always the same&mdash;always a kind
look and a gentle word. "My good Hoosanee,
my kind Hoosanee"&mdash;master, I hear her voice
in my sleep, and I spring up and say to myself
that if I do not go to her, if I do not try to save
her, I am black of heart and degraded. Let me
go then, I beseech you!'</p>

<p>'Hoosanee, it is neither fair nor right.
Twice&mdash;three times&mdash;you have been in peril
for me. You will become known. They will
call you a spy&mdash;a spy of the Feringhees&mdash;and
then what treatment can you hope for?'</p>

<p>'I can die, master,' said Hoosanee, nobly.
'That has been the fate of better men than I am
in these last few days. But I do not think I
shall die. I have that within me which says
that I shall live to see these cruel days at an
end. And does my master think that I will
show the same face as I have done to
these men? He must know little of the resources
of the Indian. I will change myself
so that my own father would not know
me. Did my master know Subdul Khan
when he went into the midst of the enemy's
camp?'</p>

<p>'So you have heard of our adventure?' said
Tom. Full of anguish as he was, he smiled
faintly at the memory of that strange evening.
'Subdul was certainly sublime,' he went on.
'But you have only just come in, and he has
left. How did you hear?'</p>

<p>'My master's friends are everywhere,' replied
Hoosanee tranquilly. 'In all this region there is
scarcely a village where they are not to be found.
Byrajee Pirtha Raj, our revered ruler, was well
known and warmly loved. Is not my master
his true son?'</p>

<p>'If this is so,' said Tom, his voice trembling,
'if I have many friends amongst this people, is
not that the more reason that I should go forth?
I must, Hoosanee, I will. I tell you that if I
stay I shall go mad.'</p>

<p>For a few moments Hoosanee paused. Then
he went nearer to his master and threw himself
at his feet. 'Will my lord pardon me?' he said
in a low and humble voice, 'if I speak the thing
that is in my heart.'</p>

<p>'Say what you will, Hoosanee. After what
you have done for me it would be strange if I
could be angry with you. But get up and speak
quickly,' said Tom. 'Before the night is over I
must be gone.'</p>

<p>'Master, that is just it!' cried Hoosanee.
'Should my master go? Listen! My lord who
has gone&mdash;the mighty and excellent Byrajee
Pirtha Raj&mdash;was once in such a difficulty as this
of my lord's. Duty to his State and the good of
his people drew him one way. On the other
side&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Hush, Hoosanee! I will not listen to you.
I know what you would say. Chunder Singh
has said it before you; but it is useless. Nay,
if the voice&mdash;&mdash;! Ah! Why did you recall it?
I will be myself to-night. I will not be another.'
He had been talking in Hindostanee. Suddenly
he paused. The words of the language which
in these last few weeks had become to him
almost as familiar as his own fled from his lips.
It was in English&mdash;the dear language that had
been his from his infancy, the language in which
he had learned, and dreamed, and loved, and
suffered, in which he had fought his childish
battles and won the praise of those who were
dearer to him than his life&mdash;that the thoughts
welling up hotly from his passionate heart found
utterance.</p>

<p>'Is it not enough?' he cried&mdash;not to his
servant, for he had forgotten his presence&mdash;'is
it not enough? Am I to be tortured for ever?
I have tried this double life, and I cannot live it;
I must choose to be one, and I choose to be
myself. I am Tom Gregory. I am Grace's
lover.'</p>

<p>There was a pause, during which he seemed
to be listening to voices in the air. Hoosanee
threw himself on his face and lay like one
dead. Darkness gathered about them, and the
silence in the great room was as the silence of
the grave. And then the rajah's voice, deep
and passionate, broke forth again.</p>

<p>'What are all these to me, cruel voice?
Stay! Stay! For God's sake do not answer
me yet, for I must fight this thing out with myself!
She is one&mdash;an English girl, forsaken and
distressed, and in danger of her life, a life that
has little value for anyone but me. And they
are many&mdash;thousands upon thousands. And,
through them, I may influence countless myriads
more. Do I not know it well? On the one side
all these holding out their hands to me. On the
other the little soft trembling hand of my love.'
His voice broke. There followed another few
moments of silence, and then he cried out again:
'Great heavens! why do I stop? Grace in
danger! Is this paralysis that is stealing over
me? I will shake it off. I will show them all,
visible and invisible, that I have a will, that I
can choose and act. Hoosanee!'</p>

<p>The piercing voice acted like an electric
shock. Hoosanee sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>'I thought you were asleep,' said Tom in
Hindostanee; 'as you are awake I want you to
answer me two or three questions. Answer
directly, for my stock of patience is nearly at an
end.'</p>

<p>'Let my master speak,' said Hoosanee.</p>

<p>'If I confide in you,' said Tom, 'will you
obey me blindly? Come, yes or no? I have
had enough of arguments.'</p>

<p>'I am, as I have always been, his Honour's
servant,' said Hoosanee with dignity.</p>

<p>'I suppose I must be contented with that,'
said Tom, smiling grimly. 'Will you be silent?'</p>

<p>'As silent as the grave, my master.'</p>

<p>'Come, that at least has the merit of directness.
You know Ganesh? Do you consider
that you know him well?'</p>

<p>'I have known him for many years, Excellency.'</p>

<p>'You have reason to believe that he is a faithful
servant?'</p>

<p>'Why does my lord&mdash;&mdash;?'</p>

<p>'We may come to that presently. Answer
my question before you put questions of your
own.'</p>

<p>'Master, I have no wish and no reason to
blacken the face of my fellow-servant before
your Highness, but if my lord looks for a companion
in this adventure it is not Ganesh that he
should choose.'</p>

<p>'Why, Hoosanee?'</p>

<p>'He is a proud man, and a man of high
caste. He could not change his countenance or
serve my lord with subtlety, as Hoosanee or
Subdul Khan could do.'</p>

<p>'Is this your only reason for thinking that
he is not the man to go with me?'</p>

<p>'What other reason&mdash;&mdash;?'</p>

<p>'For Heaven's sake answer me directly.
Have I not told you that my stock of patience is
nearly at an end?'</p>

<p>'I have no other reason,' said Hoosanee with
dignity.</p>

<p>'Then go, my good Hoosanee, go at once,
without asking me a single question, and tell
Ganesh that I want him.'</p>

<p>Casting a look of wonder, not unmixed with
reproach, on his master, Hoosanee obeyed. He
was away some two or three minutes, for Ganesh,
who had been sleeping in one of the corridors,
would not appear before his master without
carefully adjusting his turban and girdle. These
minutes were spent by Tom in pacing his room
rapidly, trying by the strong physical exercise to
stifle thoughts.</p>

<p>'What a time you have been!' he said, when
Ganesh, who looked as dignified, watchful, and
correct, as if sleep were an impossible weakness,
stood before him.</p>

<p>'And yet I have made haste,' he said humbly.
'His Excellency is surely more impatient than
usual?'</p>

<p>'You are right, Ganesh, I am impatient.
But what is that to you? I sent for you because
I wish you to guide me at once to Dost Ali
Khan's camp.'</p>

<p>'Dost Ali Khan, your Highness!' Ganesh's
eyes were fixed on Hoosanee.</p>

<p>'Are you afraid that Hoosanee should hear
the name of your friend?' said Tom.</p>

<p>'Why should I fear?' answered Ganesh
boldly. 'My heart is white. Does his Highness
wish that Hoosanee shall accompany us?'</p>

<p>'If it is his desire.'</p>

<p>'My lord knows,' said Hoosanee, 'what my
desire is.'</p>

<p>'You would go without me, but that is impossible.
And now, without any more loss of
time, to our arrangements. Ganesh, how far is
the camp from this?'</p>

<p>'It is not to a camp; it is to a fort that I am
desired to take your Highness.'</p>

<p>'Where is it situated?'</p>

<p>'My lord will forgive me. I am forbidden
to say. This I may tell him, that it is only one
day's journey from the boundaries of Gumilcund.'</p>

<p>'So near? If we press our pace we may go
and return before they miss us here,' said Tom.
'But why not tell me where the fort is? If I go
with you I must certainly find out.'</p>

<p>'Will my lord pardon me? I am taking my
instructions from others, and it is only in this
way that I can help him. When he leaves
Gumilcund he must go in a closed litter as a
high-caste woman. If Hoosanee will go with
us, his eyes must be covered till he reaches the
boundaries of the forest.'</p>

<p>'But it is impossible! You are dreaming,
Ganesh!'</p>

<p>'I wish I were dreaming, my lord. I wish
I could take you to the dwelling of Dost Ali
Khan by a bolder and surer way. But I have
sworn by my God to show to no one the road
thither. If my lord cannot give himself blindly
into my hands he must think of it no more.'</p>

<p>For a second or two Tom paused. His eyes,
piercing as stars, were fixed upon the face of
Ganesh, who stood before him erect and proud,
not so much as an eyelid trembling. At last he
held out his hand.</p>

<p>'I believe you,' he said; 'make your own
arrangements. If you are false to me&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'If I am false, my lord, let death come upon
me swiftly, and let my soul go down into hell,'
said Ganesh fervently. 'Will my lord pardon
me if I leave him for an hour? When I return
I shall hope to tell him that everything is ready
for a start.'</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door of the room.</p>

<p>'One moment,' whispered Ganesh, as Hoosanee
went towards it, 'I must not be seen here.'</p>

<p>'True; Chunder Singh wants to stop me
from leaving,' said Tom. 'Hide!'</p>

<p>Ganesh withdrew into the shadows&mdash;seemed
literally to vanish into them, for Tom,
who thought that he had his eyes upon him,
could not tell the exact moment or the manner
of his disappearing. There had been three in the
room. There were now only two. The knocking
was repeated. 'Go and see who it is,' said
Tom to Hoosanee; 'whoever it may be, I must
not allow him to stay with me long.'</p>

<p>Hoosanee drew aside the purdah before the
doors and threw them open, and in the next
moment Chunder Singh, followed by the English
Resident, entered the room.</p>

<p>The minister cast a rapid and searching
glance round the apartment, saw no one but
Hoosanee and the young rajah, and, having
made his salutation, drew back.</p>

<p>The Resident came forward with outstretched
hand. 'You will forgive my intrusion, I am
sure,' he said; 'but, when I heard that the poor
ladies from Nowgong had arrived safely, I felt
that I must thank and congratulate you.'</p>

<p>'Their safety is as dear to me as it is to you,
sir,' answered Tom with some reserve. He was
meditating how, without giving offence, he could
get rid of his visitor.</p>

<p>The visitor, meanwhile, did not seem to be in
any hurry. He was an expansive person, and he
had a fine flow of language at his command, and
having come across an Indian rajah who seemed
to be as familiar with English as he was himself,
he rather enjoyed the prospect of letting out
some of his imprisoned ideas, the more so that
Chunder Singh, prime minister to this mysterious
young prince, and evidently a person of some
insight, had begged him to impress certain views
upon him.</p>

<p>'It is very kind of you to feel so,' he said, in
answer to Tom's last remark. We should observe,
in passing, that he had, as yet, only seen the rajah
in such a subdued light as the present, and that
he knew nothing of him, excepting that he was
the adopted son of Byrajee Pirtha Raj, and that
Lord Dalhousie, in consideration of the long and
close alliance between the rulers of Gumilcund
and the English, had pledged himself to sanction
his succession.</p>

<p>'May I stay with you for a short time?' he
went on; 'you smoke, I smoke too. If that
would help talk&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I have made a vow not to smoke until an
object very near my heart is fulfilled,' said Tom
gravely. 'But that need not debar you from
smoking if you will.'</p>

<p>He had neither sat down himself nor asked
his visitor to take a seat. This was so unusual
a circumstance that Chunder Singh, who, in the
belief that his young master would speak more
confidentially to his countryman if he were absent,
was retreating towards the door, could not help
pausing for a moment, and looking at him
inquiringly.</p>

<p>'Join us if you will, Chunder Singh,' said
Tom. 'I have nothing secret to say to Mr.
Montgomery. In fact,' passing his hand over
his eyes, 'I am afraid I should not be able
either to talk or to listen very well to-night. It
has been an exciting season, sir,' to the Resident,
'anxiety, labour, early and late hours, and I,
you see, am new to this sort of thing.'</p>

<p>'Ah! yes, yes. So I believe. The late rajah
might have done more wisely, perhaps, if he had
accustomed you a little to the position. I said
so to him more than once. "Your heir," I
said, "ought to be with you. An English education
is all very well in its way, and, up to a
certain point, nothing could be more advantageous.
But there is a limit." Well, that is all
over. No doubt he expected to live much
longer. Ah! his death was a sad blow to us
all. I look upon it now as the beginning of all
this misery. What do you think?'</p>

<p>'I am afraid I am not capable of any serious
thoughts to-night,' said Tom; 'my eyes are nearly
closed.'</p>

<p>'Dear, dear! I am very sorry, and I had
so much to say to you; however, it will keep,
no doubt. I will come to-morrow, with your
kind permission, and pay my respects to the
ladies, who may be glad to see the face of a
fellow countryman, and you will allow me, then,
perhaps, to express my deep sense&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Thank you,' interrupted the rajah, 'there is
no need. As I have before had the honour of
telling you, I look upon these English ladies as
my sisters and personal friends.'</p>

<p>It was a little, just a little, audacious, the
Resident thought. His sisters, indeed! Englishwomen!
But those were not days when one
could afford to slight friends, and he made the
ordinary polite acknowledgments.</p>

<p>'As for to-morrow,' went on the young rajah,
'I am afraid that I shall be engaged all day. I
am under a vow, as I have told you. No business
connected with the State will require my
presence, and I very much doubt whether I
shall leave these rooms. In a few days, however,
I will do myself the pleasure of calling upon you.'</p>

<p>It was a dismissal. The Resident bowed
and withdrew, wondering over the dignity and
reasonableness of the young rajah. 'Only
shows what English education can do,' he said
to himself.</p>

<p>Chunder Singh, in the meantime, lingered
for a few moments. 'Your Excellency will
really try to rest?' he said anxiously.</p>

<p>'Of course I will, Chunder. Don't you see
that my eyes are half shut already?' answered
Tom. 'Now pray leave me.'</p>

<p>'Will you promise me&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'How dare you speak to me so?' cried the
young fellow, lashing himself into a rage which
he was far from feeling. 'Promise you, indeed!
I will promise you nothing. Do you suppose
that because I have accepted you as my counsellor,
and listened to your advice, I intend to
give myself up to you entirely? If you do, let
me tell you that you are extraordinarily mistaken.
I will do what I think right.'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes; so long as my lord does not run
into danger!' cried Chunder Singh piteously.</p>

<p>'My dear friend,' said Tom, in his most
English fashion, 'let me entreat you not to be a
fool. When I say that I decline to be dictated
to, that does not mean that I intend to assert
myself by deliberately thrusting my head into a
lion's mouth, or doing anything else of the same
ridiculous nature. And now, for heaven's sake,
go away! I like you too well, and I respect
you too much, to wish to quarrel with you; but
I tell you plainly that I am not quite answerable
to myself to-night. If you continue to stand
there looking at me in that absurdly piteous
way I shall say or do something foolish.'
Sighing deeply and making a respectful salutation,
Chunder Singh, to whom this new attitude
of his young master was deeply bewildering,
not to say alarming, took his leave.</p>

<p>In the corridor he paused. Hoosanee was
still with the rajah. There was no one else.
The rest of the servants were scattered. Several
of them had been told off to attend upon the
new inmates of the palace. The corridor was
empty and very silent. Between the entrance
to the rajah's apartment and the staircase lay
the mattress which Hoosanee had been formerly
in the habit of using at night, and which on his
return had been spread for him again. Chunder
Singh sat down upon it, determining to remain
where he was until the exit of Hoosanee, when
he would confer with him on the new danger
that seemed to threaten the State. He sat
where he was for a long time, and at last, vigilant
as he had determined to be, his eyes grew
dim. Again and again he tried to arouse himself,
and again and again he dropped off into a
doze. He felt persuaded, however, as he asserted
later, that, if the door of the rajah's apartment
had opened once, he must have heard it. So in
ineffectual attempts to keep on the alert the
hours of the night passed by.</p>

<p>Towards morning, being now fully persuaded
that, contrary to his usual custom, the rajah
had kept his servant in his room, he fell into a
deep sleep from which he was aroused finally
by sounds of movement in the palace. Then, a
little ashamed of his want of dignity, sleeping at
his master's door&mdash;he, an old minister of the
State, like a personal servant&mdash;he crept off to
his own house.</p>

<h4>THE ENGLISH LADIES IN THE RAJAH'S PALACE</h4>


<p>Chunder Singh had been about an hour in his
house, which was situated only a few yards
distant from the palace, whither, not feeling
perfectly easy about his master, he was thinking
of returning, when he heard a murmur as of
many people running together in the market-square.
He went out and saw a large crowd
round his house. As soon as he appeared, its
foremost members called out to him. 'Chunder
Singh will tell us the truth,' they said. 'Yes,
yes,' cried others; 'Chunder Singh has never
deceived us.'</p>

<p>Wondering what this might mean, the
minister closed the door of his house and set his
back against it. He saw now that the throng
of people were being reinforced every moment
by streams from the avenues that converged
towards the market-place, which was already
one unbroken sea of turbaned heads and fluttering
garments. 'Why is this?' he said. 'What
has made you come together?'</p>

<p>There stepped out of the crowd one well
known in the palace. He was the chief of the
merchant-caste&mdash;a man of large wealth and
larger patriotism, who had given with a free
hand towards the defence of the city and the
equipment of the force that had just started for
Delhi.</p>

<p>'Give them a word of comfort and assurance,
Chunder Singh,' he said. 'Some foolish person
has spread about the rumour that our young
rajah has left the city and joined Dost Ali
Khan, who, they say, will win him to his side
by giving up into his hands an English captive.
I have told them that the rumour is false; but
they will not believe me, and it is true that I
have spent the night in my own house. You,
as they have heard, were in the palace. You
will know if anyone left it.'</p>

<p>'This is a strange story,' said Chunder Singh,
gravely.</p>

<p>'Is it true?' asked the merchant.</p>

<p>'No; no. It is false. It is impossible.'</p>

<p>Chunder Singh drew back, and, mounting
the little platform before his house, looked the
crowd proudly in the face. 'I wonder,' he said,
'that the citizens of Gumilcund should allow
themselves to be moved by so foolish a rumour.
I spent the night in the rajah's palace. Being
too weary to move, I rested on a bed outside
the door of his room. If anyone had passed
out, I should certainly have known it. Go to
your homes in peace. I will ask the rajah to
ride through his city to-day.'</p>

<p>With loyal shouts, the easily satisfied crowd
dispersed, and in a few minutes the market-square
resumed its ordinary aspect. Then
Chunder Singh, whose face was curiously contracted,
turned to the merchant. 'There is a
grain of truth in this, Lutfullah,' he said, in a
subdued voice. 'Dost Ali Khan has sent a
tempting message to our rajah. He would not
betray us&mdash;I am too sure of him to fear that.
But my dread is that he will perversely run into
danger, and that we shall lose the succession
promised to us.'</p>

<p>'You are certain that he did not leave last
night,' said Lutfullah, who looked serious.</p>

<p>'To that I would pledge my life,' answered
the minister. 'And he cannot have gone this
morning. There were too many people about
him.'</p>

<p>'We must set a watch on the palace,' said
Lutfullah.</p>

<p>'Yes; we must set a watch. You will help
me. We must save him, even from himself if
it must be,' said Chunder Singh.</p>

<p>They went to the palace together. Everything
seemed as usual in the outer and inner
courts. Passing through an arched passage,
they went into the garden at the back of the
palace. Since Aglaia had come, the rajah was
often to be found there in the early morning,
either pacing one of the shaded alleys, with the
child beside him, or sharing a breakfast of fruit
and milk with her in the darkened and artificially
cooled summer-house. And, indeed, they
had scarcely entered the rajah's favourite walk
before they saw the little figure of Aglaia,
quaint and lovely in a gauzy Indian dress. She
was walking more sedately than usual, for a
creature still smaller than herself&mdash;a wizened,
white-faced baby, dressed in strange nondescript
garments&mdash;was toddling by her side.</p>

<p>'Isn't he a darling?' she said to Chunder
Singh, whom she always addressed in English.
'He's just had his breakfast, and I've brought
him out to see Daddy Tom.'</p>

<p>'And have you seen him yet, Missy?' said
Chunder Singh, gravely.</p>

<p>'Why,' said Aglaia, looking up at her Indian
friend, 'what a funny face you have this morning,
Mr. Chunder! Aren't you glad to see little
Dick? That's his name. He mustn't walk far,
for his mother says his legs have got cramped.
Just think! He was ten days in a cart. Is 'oo
tired, little pet?' she said lispingly to the baby.
'Shall Aglaia&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'No, no, Missy-sahib,' cried the ayah,
running up. 'Too small, you! Ayah, give
poor baba.'</p>

<p>But the poor baba, who was a person, in an
ordinary way, of irrepressible activity, refused
to be taken up. He seated himself on the grass,
struck out with his little fists, and looked up at
them with a delicious smile of baby contentment.
Then Aglaia assailed him with kisses, and
Chunder Singh and Lutfullah, who, for all their
grave looks, were men of most tender disposition,
smiled at one another and passed on. It was
quite evident that Aglaia had no thoughts even
for Daddy Tom that morning. She was wholly
absorbed in little Dick.</p>

<p>The rajah was not in his summer-house, and
the attendant in that charming retreat, who
was the daily purveyor of his Highness's little
breakfast, had not as yet received any orders
from him.</p>

<p>Retracing their steps to the palace, which
the rajah did not seem to have quitted that
morning, the two elderly men looked a little blue.</p>

<p>They made their way straight to Tom's
sleeping apartment. Chunder Singh knocked,
but he received no answer. He knocked again,
and, after waiting for about a quarter of an
hour, tried the handle cautiously. He found
that it was bolted on the inside, and turned a
relieved face to Lutfullah.</p>

<p>'He must be within,' he said. 'No one else
would presume to draw the bolt. No doubt he
was awake all night, and fell asleep towards the
morning. We must have patience.'</p>

<p>They left Hussein Buksh, the second bearer,
one of Chunder Singh's own nominees, at the
door, desiring him to let them know the moment
the rajah stirred, and went down themselves into
the garden. There they found the three English
ladies who had arrived the night before gathered
together in a little group round the children.
They wore, with a curious awkwardness, lovely
Indian dresses, some of which, as being the best
he could procure, Tom had laid in store to meet
such an emergency as this. Their faces were
very pale, and the haggard anxiety, the horror,
remembered or expected, which gave so piteous
an expression to our countrywomen in these
dreadful days, had not left their faces; but the
quiet night and the peaceful awakening had refreshed
them, and they were already very different
from the wretched, bedraggled-looking creatures
who had driven through Gumilcund on the previous
evening.</p>

<p>Chunder Singh and Lutfullah saluted the
ladies reverently. Lucy, who was talking to
Aglaia, a little apart from the others, eyed them
with some curiosity. 'The major-domo of the
palace,' she whispered, 'and one of the chief
citizens. How funny it all is! Something like
the middle ages.' The mother of the white-faced
baby was, in the meantime, answering
Chunder Singh's inquiries, and expressing her
satisfaction in having reached so pleasant a
haven of rest.</p>

<p>'Does the major-domo understand English?'
asked Lucy.</p>

<p>Aglaia nodded. 'Oh! yes. He's a nice man.
I like him,' said the child.</p>

<p>'Then I must speak to him,' said Lucy. With
her white face and golden hair, and large, childish-looking
eyes, Lucy looked quaint and very pretty
that morning. She had been given her choice
amongst a number of dresses, and she had picked
out a tunic of cherry-coloured silk and a snow-white
saree of the finest muslin, deeply trimmed
with gold embroideries. To put on these pretty
fresh garments after her copious bath of warm
scented water had given poor Lucy a sense of
satisfaction, which, when she came to think of it
seriously, seemed curiously inappropriate, if not
wicked. But she could not help herself; she
was happier than she had been, and the pretty
dress, which suited her to perfection, had something
to say to her happiness. Pressing forward
she addressed Chunder Singh:</p>

<p>'Oh!' she cried, 'where is the rajah, the
person, I mean, who received us last night? He
is the rajah, isn't he?'</p>

<p>'Yes, madam. It was our rajah&mdash;the ruler of
Gumilcund&mdash;who had the honour of welcoming
you to his palace last night,' said Chunder Singh,
nearly paralysing the childish little creature with
his dignity. She fixed her limpid eyes upon him
doubtingly; then recovering herself with an effort:</p>

<p>'Oh, yes,' she said, 'I was told so. Could
you tell him please&mdash;the rajah, I mean&mdash;his Excellency&mdash;is
that the way to speak to the great
people here, Aglaia&mdash;?'</p>

<p>Chunder Singh was waiting respectfully for
the conclusion of her sentence.</p>

<p>'I want particularly to speak to him,' went
on Lucy more fluently. 'Perhaps you wouldn't
mind saying that I have a message for him&mdash;I
suppose,' looking round at the other ladies with
some bewilderment, 'that it is for him. You
know he told us he was an Englishman; but
this isn't much like an English house. And how
does he come to be a rajah? Oh! dear, if Grace
could only have come herself!'</p>

<p>'His Excellency was educated in England,'
broke in the mellifluous voice of Chunder Singh.</p>

<p>'And some of us think him more English
than Indian,' added Lutfullah pleasantly.</p>

<p>'You can speak English too, chief citizen!'
cried Lucy. 'This is most extraordinary. Really
I begin to think that we must have died last
night, and that we are in a sort of half-English,
half-Indian paradise. But,' with a deep sigh,
'that can't be, for Grace would certainly have
been here before us. Oh, my poor Grace! my
dear Grace! Can't anyone tell me where you
are?'</p>

<p>'Hush! Lucy. Hush! We shall never
know how they went. She and my lovely Kit,'
cried Mrs. Durant, weeping bitterly. 'Little
could I have thought to what his love for her
would have brought him&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Do you give them up?' cried Lucy, flashing
round upon her friend fiercely. '<i>I</i> don't, and
just because they are together! Oh! Mr. Major-domo,
if you have a heart&mdash;and you look as if
you had&mdash;find this mysterious prince, who is an
Englishman and not an Englishman, and ask
him, for pity's sake, to speak to us.'</p>

<p>'No doubt his Highness will request the
honour of speech with you later,' said Chunder
Singh. 'At present he must not be disturbed.'</p>

<p>'Did he say so? Oh! where is he?' sobbed
Lucy. 'He can't know how dreadful the danger
is! I was ashamed of myself for being able to
sleep last night. If Grace dies'&mdash;clutching at
her muslin robe after a fashion that, to the grave
Indian, was scarcely decorous. 'If Grace dies,
I shall never forgive myself.'</p>

<p>'I will see if his Highness is awake,' said
Chunder Singh retreating, while Lucy, now in a
perfect paroxysm of grief, was led to the summer-house
by her companions.</p>

<p>There they waited for a long time. The sun
rose high in the heavens, and, outside the
summer-house, the air was like that of a heated
oven; but here there were punkahs swinging
slowly, and darkened windows, and splashing
water, so that they scarcely felt the heat. Meantime
attendants came and went, bringing them
books and music and food and drink, and toys
and pictures for the children; but, ask as they
would, there came no message from the rajah.</p>

<p>'I cannot stand it,' cried Lucy at last. 'I
had rather not be so comfortable. I will go out
and see what it all means.'</p>

<p>'Go out into that sun! Don't behave like a
mad girl! Do you wish to bring more trouble
upon us? You think only of yourself,' said
Kit's mother reproachfully.</p>

<p>And so, being, as I have said, a childish little
creature, and accustomed to rebuke, Lucy sat
on with red eyes and trembling fingers, trying
to amuse herself and feel comfortable; but possessed,
all the time, with a sense of sorrow and
remorse that nearly crushed her.</p>

<p>At last, when the heat of the day was over,
and the sky behind the trees that sheltered their
retreat was all ablaze with gold and crimson,
she saw Chunder Singh coming slowly towards
them. His face was covered, and his head had
dropped upon his breast, and in the dark eyes
that looked out from the folds of his chuddah
there was a strange glitter. Lucy had been
running out to meet him; but when she saw
those blazing eyes she withdrew.</p>

<p>'Something has happened,' she whispered to
Aglaia. 'You know him better than we do,
child. Ask him what it is!'</p>

<p>Then Aglaia ran out, and Lucy, who was
trembling from head to foot, heard her little
baby voice.</p>

<p>'Do bring Daddy-Tom,' she said. 'He hasn't
been to see us all the day.'</p>

<p>'Missy,' said Chunder Singh, in grave, sad
tones, 'ask Miss Sahib and the Mem Sahibs
where his Excellency is.'</p>

<p>He was at the door of the summer-house,
and as he spoke these ominous words, he looked
round upon them searchingly.</p>

<p>'Ask <i>us</i>!' cried Lucy hysterically. 'What
does the strange man mean?'</p>

<p>'Madam,' said Chunder Singh, bowing low,
'you must have the goodness to come with me.'</p>

<p>'I?' shrieked Lucy. 'Why? What do you
want with me? Oh!' falling on her knees,
'have pity! If he has gone, I know nothing
about it. I may have meant to ask him; but I
hadn't the chance. Ask the others. We saw
him for a few little moments last evening, and
to-day we have been alone. Indeed! indeed!
no one has come to us. Oh! don't you believe
me?'</p>

<p>'Let me assure you, before those here, who
will remember my words,' said Chunder Singh,
'that we mean you no harm. If you fear, let
Missy Sahib and her ayah come with you. Our
rajah has gone. How he has gone, or why, we
cannot as yet find out; and as Hoosanee, the
servant who brought you to Gumilcund, has
gone also, we would ask you the questions which
we would have asked him had he been here.
Miss Sahib I ask to come because she is most
interested in what has happened. But if one of
the Mem Sahibs&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'No, no, no. Take me! I will tell you all
I can,' sobbed Lucy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Terribly solemn and staggering beyond the
power of language to express were Lucy's next
experiences. There was first a brief journey in
a litter, with Aglaia, to whom she had clung as
her only hope and consolation, for a companion.
The litter was put down, and, upon drawing its
curtains aside, they found themselves in a small,
dimly-lighted hall, in the presence of four men,
all of them as grave and mysterious of aspect as
Chunder Singh. They were seated on cushions
at the upper end of the hall; but when Lucy
drew the curtains of her litter aside, one of them
rose to his feet and greeted her reverently.
There followed a few moments of silence, during
which the poor little creature, who could not
imagine what all this solemnity meant, felt her
heart beating as if it would burst.</p>

<p>Aglaia had made the acquaintance of all
these grave persons, and she was not in the
least awed. Yet they constituted the inner
council of the Gumilcund State. One was
Chunder Singh, the prime minister, and another&mdash;he
who had risen&mdash;was Lutfullah, the
representative of the merchant class, and the third was
Vishnugupta the priest, and the fourth was the
exalted citizen who headed the warrior caste and
directed the organisation of the rajah's little army.</p>

<p>These good persons wore their dresses of
state, and the dignity of their manners was fully
equal to the grandeur of their appearance.
When Aglaia, who, as I have said, had no fear,
ran up to the magnificent Lutfullah, and began
chattering to him in her baby Hindoostanee,
nodding gravely meanwhile to her other friends,
Lucy felt half afraid that the roof of the hall
would drop down upon them.</p>

<p>But nothing happened, and she began presently
to feel a little more composed. Then
Lutfullah, who, having a bland manner and
reassuring aspect, and being, moreover, well
versed in the English tongue, had been commissioned
to ask the questions which the council
had decided to be necessary, said, in a soft voice,
that he trusted she would not feel the least
alarm. It was true that a calamity had fallen
upon the State, and it was true also that they,
into whose hands the direction of its fortunes
had come, were for the moment embarrassed
and disheartened; but that was no reason why
the guests of the State should suffer. As far as
she was concerned, all they wished was an
account of the events that had intervened between
the moment of their leaving the station
of Nowgong and the present, with special reference
to the unfortunate occurrence that, as he
understood, had preceded their arrival.</p>

<p>It was a most stately preamble. Lucy, who
was not without a sense of the fitness of things,
tried to still her beating heart and to answer it
with becoming dignity. And, in fact, she made
a pretty fair start. But, as she went on, as she
tried to draw a picture of what Grace was to her
and to them all, as she entered upon a narration
of the events that led to their separation, her
dignity evaporated in gasping, spasmodic phrases;
and tears, that not even the august presence of
these stately citizens could repress, poured from
her eyes.</p>

<p>They listened in perfect silence. Aglaia, who
did not fully understand what was happening,
crept up close to her, and whispered to her not
to cry. The poor little ayah sat in the background
sobbing&mdash;like a child. Lucy felt as if she
could not go through with it. But at last it was
over. Now they would let her go, and she
could cry her heart out. Not yet, poor little
Lucy! It is Chunder Singh who stands up, and
he has thrown back the chuddah from his face,
which looks curiously determined.</p>

<p>'We thank you, Miss Sahib,' he says in his
grave and sonorous English. 'But there is yet
one thing more that we would know. You
spoke to me this morning of a message.'</p>

<p>'Oh! yes. I had a message; but it was not
for any of you,' cries Lucy, starting up. 'It
was for him.'</p>

<p>'If he is not here&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Then I must keep it for him until he comes
back.'</p>

<p>'Will Miss Sahib pardon her servant&mdash;&mdash;?'</p>

<p>'No, no, no. Oh! I cannot tell you. How
can I? They were her last words. I should be
a traitor.'</p>

<p>'We thought that if we heard the message
sent to his Excellency it would help us to find
him. That is all,' says Lutfullah gently.
'Chunder Singh, my good friend, it is enough,'
he adds in a lower voice. 'Let her go!'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes; let her go!' say the others. And
Lucy&mdash;oh! so thankful to be released&mdash;draws
round her the silken curtains of the litter, and
Aglaia gives her hand to the ayah, and, while
they go back to the palace, the four ancients of
Gumilcund hold a council as to what is to be
done for the State.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h5><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII</a></h5>

<h4>NO NEWS</h4>


<p>That was Lucy's last piece of excitement for
some considerable time. When, having been
carried back to the palace, she fell weeping into
the arms of her friends, there began for her and
the others a life of the most bewildering monotony.
A part of the palace, consisting of a
small pillared hall, and two or three sleeping
apartments, with the shaded alley in which
Chunder Singh and Lutfullah had met them
first, and the rajah's summer-house were allotted
to them. Day after day, with clock-like regularity,
a liberal provision of meats and drinks,
water to their hearts' desire, fresh garments,
sweetmeats, and books were brought to them.
They had everything, in fact, but that for which
they craved the most&mdash;news.</p>

<p>Chunder Singh and Lutfullah went to see
them occasionally, and sent morning and night
to inquire after their health. Mr. Montgomery,
the Resident, paid them periodical visits, but
there was no word of the rajah.</p>

<p>Mysterious to the ladies, to Aglaia, to whom
her deliverer was everything, this sudden disappearance
was a shock as cruel as it was
inexplicable. Where had her Daddy-Tom gone?
she would ask piteously. Why hadn't he said
good-bye to her? Couldn't he send her a letter
if he liked? Questions which no one, not even
the wise Chunder Singh, could answer. Had it
not been for baby Dick, who was one of the
most restless of little persons, she would have
suffered even more severely. In the new healthy
atmosphere that surrounded him, Dick had
recovered his vigour. The wizened little face
was filling up. Roses and dimples were asserting
their rights. The long pent-up limbs were
expanding luxuriously in all sorts of joyous
activities, which Aglaia, who had begun by
being his slave, was bound to share. Never
was a merrier or a more irrepressible little man
than Dick.</p>

<p>Sometimes, worn out by games and laughter,
he would fall asleep, and then Aglaia would
steal quietly to the lattice, and, the tears dropping
from her eyes, would watch and watch.
'Oh! if he would only come&mdash;if he would only
come!'</p>

<p>'Everyone goes away,' she said to Lucy one
day. 'I wonder why?'</p>

<p>'I don't know, dear,' said Lucy, who was
becoming more and more melancholy. 'I suppose
they must.'</p>

<p>'He needn't,' said Aglaia proudly. 'He is
the master of everyone here.'</p>

<p>'Your Daddy-Tom, as you call him, is like
the Good Shepherd in the parable,' said Lucy.
'Do you remember?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Aglaia, in a low voice, her little
face becoming strangely set. 'He left all the
others.'</p>

<p>'And he went after the one that was lost,'
filled in Lucy with a sigh. 'I always thought it
was uninteresting to be one of the ninety-and-nine.
I am sure of it now.'</p>

<p>'I don't understand,' said Aglaia wearily.</p>

<p>'Of course you don't, and I am a goose&mdash;an
ungrateful goose, too,' said Lucy, her eyes filling
with tears. 'If he only brings back Grace&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Is that her name?' said Aglaia.</p>

<p>'Yes; isn't it pretty? And it's just like herself.
Dearest Grace! We should never be dull
or miserable if she were here.'</p>

<p>'Tell me what she is like,' said Aglaia.</p>

<p>'What Grace is like? Ah! that's not so
easy,' said Lucy enthusiastically. 'She is
perfectly lovely to begin with, tall and very slender&mdash;oh!
my darling'&mdash;breaking into tears and
sobs&mdash;'if you are alive, you must be more than
slender now. All these days and nights! I
can't bear to think of it. She was so gentle,
too. I never heard her complain once. And
her temper was that of an angel. Everyone&mdash;even
the servants&mdash;adored her. It was through
Tikaram's love for her that we got away at all.
As for the man who brought us here, he simply
worshipped her. Don't you hope she may come
back safely, Aglaia?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' answered the child, briefly and sadly.</p>

<p>'But you don't seem a bit sorry for her, you
funny little thing.'</p>

<p>Aglaia lifted her limpid eyes and fixed them
on Lucy's face. 'I'm not,' she said.</p>

<p>'Now why, you little barbarian?'</p>

<p>'Because&mdash;&mdash;' began Aglaia, and then she
turned away. 'I don't like to talk of it,' she
said, and went off to Dick, leaving Lucy to
wonder over her curious precocity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But although the ladies heard nothing of
what went on in the city, there was considerable
uneasiness and excitement abroad. When the
elders in the State found out as a certain fact
that their young rajah had given them the slip
they tried to keep the uncomfortable knowledge
to themselves. In his room they found a slip of
paper, written in his hand, and addressed to
Chunder Singh. It was his hope, he said, that
his friends would not discover his absence until
his return, when he would give them every explanation;
but, in case of delay or obstruction,
he begged that the elders of Gumilcund would
carry on the business of the State as they had
been accustomed to do. He did not himself
anticipate any inconvenience from his own enforced
absence. When he had accomplished the
purpose upon which, as Chunder Singh knew,
his heart was set, he would return, and then it
would rest with them whether they would again
accept him as their rajah, or choose rather to be
governed by one of themselves. In the meantime
he begged to assure them of his faithfulness
to the principles which had been laid down by
his predecessors for his guidance.</p>

<p>This, to the elders of Gumilcund, while
reassuring from one point of view, was disappointing
in another. Most, if not all, had given
full credence to the assurance of their late rajah
that, in the person of the successor he had chosen,
he would himself return to them. To us of the
West such a belief may appear childish. But
we must remember the difference between our
standpoint and that of the Asiatic. The doctrine
of the transmigration of souls from body to
body, which to us seems unreal and fantastic,
has, from the earliest ages, formed a part of the
Eastern creeds. And, this granted, there could
not surely be anything extraordinarily unlikely
in one of high spiritual rank being permitted, if
not to choose, at least to foresee, his next incarnation.
In any case this was their belief, a
belief which the singular likeness between their
late rajah and his successor, with rumours which
had come to one and another of mysterious
voices holding communion with him, had served
to confirm. But his departure at this critical
moment, an action at variance with what they
knew would have been the will of their late
ruler, and his apparent readiness to sacrifice his
State so long as he could save a single English
captive, somewhat shook them in this view.
Nevertheless they tried their hardest to hide the
rajah's flight from the people. Do what they
would, however, it leaked out, and with it came
other distressing and alarming news. The surrender
of the Cawnpore entrenchments, and the
awful massacres that followed: the general rebellion
in Oude, followed swiftly by the siege of the
Lucknow Residency, and the death of Sir Henry
Lawrence: uneasy rumours from the Punjaub,
where the disaffected Poorbeahs were being held
at bay like savage animals, and the delay at Delhi&mdash;these
and many other rumours came pouring
in as the month of July ran its course. It says
much for the loyalty and strength of Chunder
Singh, who was now the ruling spirit in the
councils of the Gumilcund elders, that the terror
and despair which were beginning to be felt
amongst the populace never once touched them.</p>

<p>And yet there was much cause for uneasiness.
Chunder Singh, indeed, who had visited
England twice, the first time with Byrajee Pirtha
Raj, his late master, and the second in obedience
to his dying wish to further the interests of his
successor, believed profoundly in the power of
England; but he knew also how apt she is to
try the effect of small measures, little outbursts
which, to the uninitiated, seem nothing more
than ebullitions of temper, before, armed with
her full strength, she stands out wrathfully to
assert her will. Such delay practised now
would mean, if not the total subversion of the
English power in India, at least the temporary
ruin of those who had accepted her as the Paramount
Power. It did not need the threatening
letters which, in spite of all their efforts, were
continually poured into Gumilcund to advertise
them of what their fate would be if the English
forces&mdash;coming down from the Punjaub and up
from Calcutta and Bombay&mdash;met with any serious
defeat. Chunder Singh and his friends knew
very well what assault and sack meant when a
baffled Asiatic army were inside the gates of a
wealthy city. But with all this no thought of
compromise ever entered their minds. To the
terror-stricken people, merchants and handicraftsmen,
who came flocking to them for advice
they had always the same answer: 'We have
gone too far to retreat now. If the worst comes
to the worst we must defend our city to the last.'</p>

<p>The inquiries about the rajah were more
difficult to answer. His absence had considerably
increased the alarm of the people. For the
belief held by the men of education and culture
in Gumilcund, as it filtered down to the lower
strata of the populace, had lost its vagueness,
and had gained in strength. The curiously
dramatic entry of the young rajah into his city,
and the effectiveness of his various appearances,
gave colour to the general superstition. He
seemed to many of them not a man at all, but a
divine being whose presence was a guarantee of
the city's continuance in safety and prosperity.
That this God-given ruler should leave them at
such a crisis as the present was inexplicable save
in one way&mdash;that the spiritual beings, who were
said to direct him, had warned him of the coming
evil and helped him to escape&mdash;a theory confirmed
by the circumstance that no one could
tell them how their prince went. In spite of
all Chunder Singh and Lutfullah and Vishnugupta
could say, the hearts of the people were
heavy within them, and their minds presaged
evil.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h5><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII</a></h5>

<h4>CONTAINING EXTRACTS FROM THE RAJAH'S DIARY,
WITH HOOSANEE'S RECOLLECTIONS</h4>


<p>The rajah, as it will have already been guessed,
had discovered a secret way of leaving his
palace. Starting from a well, or small chamber
underneath his sleeping room, it led out through
a long subterranean gallery to another well, most
secretly contrived beyond the principal gate
of the city. Ganesh, who had discovered it by
accident, had made use of it to open communications
with Dost Ah Khan. Believing that the
rajah would accept the rebel chief's invitation to
a conference, he had set everything in readiness
for a departure this way. With regard to Tom's
adventures on the perilous journey thus initiated
I have been fortunate in securing narratives both
by himself and his attendants. I have said that,
in Gumilcund, he had given up recording the
events of his daily life in his diary. No sooner
had he left the State, regaining, as it seemed to
him then, his old identity, than the necessity,
which in some natures is so strong, of completing
his life by throwing its incidents into a mental
picture, reasserted itself. He wrote hurriedly
day after day, on the tablets he carried with him,
and as they, with the rest of his diary, have
been confided to my keeping, I am able to give
some extracts from them here.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'<i>July</i> 1857.&mdash;The die is cast. For better or
for worse, and I cannot now decide which it is.
I have cast off the shackles which, for these
many days, have bound me. I am thinking,
acting, living, in my own person. And the
strange part of it is that, with everything to
make me uneasy and miserable, I am happier far
and more tranquil than I have been for weeks.
That is why I am writing now.</p>

<p>'It is deep night, and we are halting&mdash;Hoosanee
and I&mdash;in the midst of a forest, while
Ganesh, our guide, goes on to make arrangements
for our admission into the fort, which is
held, as I hear, by Dost Ali Khan. I have his
safe-conduct, presented to me at Delhi, on my
person. Ganesh tells me that it has already
saved me from death once, that had I not had it
about me, the soldier Abdul&mdash;my gaoler on the
White Ranee's march&mdash;would certainly have
killed me. Possibly it may save me again. In
any case I can do no other than I have done.
Whatever the issue may be, I must await it with
fortitude. Grace, I believe, is in that fort. I
will leave it with her, or I vow before God that
I will not leave it at all. If she is dead, which
I cannot and will not believe, then I will return
to Gumilcund, and give myself up to my people,
letting them do what they will with me.</p>

<p>'The night passes slowly. Ganesh is long
away. I wonder if he really means well by us,
or if this is merely a trap laid out for our destruction.
It may be. Chunder Singh was sure
of it. And he knows the native character much
better than I do; but as I cannot draw back
now, and would not if I could, I must not dream
of failure. There are other things to think of.
In these quiet moments, solitary except for
Hoosanee, who crouches at my feet&mdash;the litter in
which I have been travelling at rest, and my little
reading-lamp making a tent of light in the dark
forest&mdash;I have time and opportunity for thought.
In Gumilcund I could not think. That sense,
half oppressive, half exultant&mdash;ah! has it not
been a great illusion? I feel so free, so natural
now: my life has become so simple&mdash;one thought
in my mind&mdash;one will animating me&mdash;one object
at my heart&mdash;that I cannot but believe I have
been tormenting myself in vain. And, indeed,
can it not be easily explained? This idea of a
double personality was the clever stroke of policy
of a clever and subtle brain that sought to project
itself into the future. And no doubt, having
allowed myself to fall into it, I have been able to
do more for the people of Gumilcund and for my
own people also than would otherwise have been
possible. So far it has been well. But it cannot
surely last for ever. It began&mdash;stay&mdash;did it
begin here? Did it even begin on board the
"Patagonia"? Before ever I met Chunder Singh&mdash;the
very night after I received news of my
inheritance, I had my first vision. The next
was when I opened the papers that were so
mysteriously lost. If then the others resulted
from my intercourse with Chunder Singh, what
was the origin of them? Some solution of the
mystery may come to me by-and-by; it seems to
me now as if there was only one way in which
that question could be answered.</p>

<p>'But I hear footsteps in the wood; I must
put my pen down.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following entries are undated; but I
know that they belong to this period.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'What a terrible&mdash;what a bewildering day
this has been! I have been thinking&mdash;I have
been talking&mdash;I have been pleading&mdash;I have been
protesting&mdash;till I scarcely know where I am or
what I am doing, and&mdash;I tremble as I write the
words&mdash;I am no nearer the accomplishment of
my object than I was when I arrived.</p>

<p>'One thing, however, seems certain. Dost
Ali Khan, though he would give worlds to detach
me and my State from the English alliance,
has no wish or intention of injuring me personally.
I confess, after all I have heard of the perfidy of
Asiatics, I am a little astonished at the gratitude
I have met with for very small favours.</p>

<p>'But I must try to put it all down in detail.
It may be useful for future reference.</p>

<p>'Early this morning I was carried into the
fort. Refreshments were placed before me; I
was allowed to adjust my dress, and then I was
led by Ganesh into the presence of the chief,
in whom, although his appearance was much
changed, I at once recognised the high-caste
youth I had fed and sheltered in my tent at
Delhi.</p>

<p>'He was alone, having dismissed his captains.
The place in which he received me was a court,
open to the sky and surrounded by galleries, in
one of which I distinctly saw a veiled lady sitting.
My heart leapt into my mouth, for I
thought it might be Grace; but I came to the
conclusion presently that it was not Grace but
Vivien, who had, as I knew, completely thrown
in her lot with the rebels.</p>

<p>'The chief greeted me with perfect courtesy,
saying that this was an honour to which he had
long been looking forward. I, feeling myself in
his power, answered after the same courteous
fashion, and after this little preliminary fencing
he began to speak about the curious and critical
state of affairs in the country. I would not interrupt
him, being anxious to know precisely
what his views were, and I confess it was a little
strange to me to hear views, set forth ably, and
urged with no little eloquence, diametrically
opposed to those I have been accustomed to
hear and to support since I came to India. For,
according to him, the English overlordship has
been a mistake from beginning to end. It has
failed in strength, in sympathy, in suitability to
the people of the land. That, sooner or later, it
would be swept away, to be replaced by a more
congenial rule, he did not for one single moment
doubt; and he strongly advised me either to go
back quietly to my own country, or if, being an
Englishman, I desired still to rule Asiatics, to
make up my mind frankly to throw in my lot
with them. A countrywoman of mine, and he
smiled in a very strange way, had come
prudently to this latter determination; and he did
not think she repented what she had done.</p>

<p>'To all this I listened as quietly as I could,
not attempting a word of contradiction.</p>

<p>'He asked me straightly if I would join them.
I answered that I could do nothing without the
consent of the elders of my people. Did I wish
them well? he went on to say. I said that I was
not sufficiently acquainted with their principles
and aims to be able to answer such a question.
I was, as he very well knew, the faithful
servant of the Government to which I owed
my advancement. Dost Ali Khan smiled at
this, and said my boldness pleased him. He
said, further, contradicting some of his previous
assertions, that if the English had behaved to
him as they had behaved to me, he would never
have taken part against them. He then asked
me if I had heard that the British army, on their
way to relieve Lucknow, had met with a serious
defeat, and been forced to fall back upon Cawnpore.
I said boldly that no such rumour had
come to me, and that even if it had I should not
have believed it. I knew indeed that General
Havelock was retreating; but his reason was
insufficiency of troops, and not defeat in battle.</p>

<p>'So, for a full hour, we fenced with one
another, for I knew the Oriental character, and
while burning to speak of my beloved Grace, I
would not court defeat by rushing upon her
name.</p>

<p>'Dost Ali Khan spoke of her first. As this is
important, I am trying to put down in my own
language a perfect transcript of his words, and
of my own answers.</p>

<p>'"I am to understand, then," he said suddenly,
"that my brother has come hither in
obedience to my message?"</p>

<p>'I answered briefly in the affirmative.</p>

<p>'He looked at me searchingly. "I gave you
to understand," he went on, "that the Englishwoman
of whom you are in search was in my
hands."</p>

<p>'I answered quietly, fighting down, as best I
could, my fiery impatience, "I trusted in Dost
Ali Khan's honour. Have I done wrongly?"</p>

<p>'"Let us wait a moment," said the wily fellow,
laughing after a fashion that made my blood
run cold. "I do not say that she is in my
hands, and into such a war as ours honour does
not enter. Have your friends and allies acted
honourably with me?"</p>

<p>'"<i>I</i> have sought to do so," I said.</p>

<p>'"You? That is true, and, if you stood alone,
I would do what I could to gratify your desires.
But you belong to the cause for which you are
fighting. I must therefore use you as I would
this weapon if I had it in my hand and saw
a deadly foe in front of me. Enough of preamble!
Say this fair Englishwoman is in my
hands, what price would you give me for
her?"</p>

<p>'"My life," I cried passionately.</p>

<p>'He smiled grimly. "Well spoken!" he said;
"but wide of the mark. My brother's life is of
no value to me. I prefer his friendship."</p>

<p>'I paused for a moment. It was difficult to
think&mdash;difficult to speak&mdash;with this terrible
excitement at my heart. At last I said slowly:</p>

<p>'"My personal friendship is yours. Give her
up&mdash;let us go away together safely, or, if you
prefer it, send her to Gumilcund under, a fitting
escort, and I give you my word that so long as
I live I will be grateful to you."</p>

<p>'"Those are fine words," said Dost Ali Khan,
and the eyes that he fixed upon my face seemed
to glitter strangely. "But I care little for
words. How will my brother show his gratitude?
Will he be on my side?"</p>

<p>'"You know I cannot," I answered. "But
this I will promise. When this mad attempt of
yours ends, as end it must, in ruin to yourself,
and the dispersion of those who now call
themselves your friends, I will stand by you as
a friend may, and plead your cause with our
Government."</p>

<p>'Scarcely suffering me to finish, he sprang to
his feet. "You are bold," he said with a harsh
laugh. "Failure? Ruin? Who dares to speak
of them here? Remember that you are not in
your own encampment at Delhi, sheltered by
the English power. You are in my dominions."</p>

<p>'I looked him full in the face. "That," I said,
"gives me courage to speak what I believe to be
the truth. Would my brother have me lie to
him because he is strong and I am weak?"</p>

<p>'The dull red which had overspread Dost Ali
Khan's dark face died down, and his fierce eyes
fell. "My brother has spoken well," he said,
"and I apologise to him for my heat. But it is
dangerous, let me tell him, to browbeat a man
in his own house."</p>

<p>'"I should prefer it," I answered, "to browbeating
him in mine."</p>

<p>'"Come," he said, with a smile, "that is a
good reproof. I have not forgotten Delhi.
Give me your hand and say what you will."</p>

<p>'Thus encouraged, I thanked him for his
goodwill and kindly remembrance, set forth my
errand in a few simple words, and besought him
not to delay me any longer. By obeying his
summons, I said, I had risked everything with
my friends at Gumilcund. Nothing but a swift
return would save my credit. If he had really
any regard for me, let him accept my assurances
of personal friendship, bring me to where my
countrywoman was, and permit us to go.</p>

<p>'But it was not to be so easily done, for
though courteous, even to deference, in his
manner, Dost Ali Khan had no intention of foregoing
the purpose with which he has brought
me to this place. Instead of answering my
question, he begged my permission to relate a
little incident. I agreed, of course, though my
heart was like to burst with impatience, and he
proceeded to tell me the following story.</p>

<p>'"A man came to me the other day, asking to
join my force. He was dressed as a peasant,
but I knew at once that he was a soldier. He
was enrolled with two or three others whom he
brought, all stalwart men. I found soon that
he had been Soubahdar in one of the finest of
the Company's regiments, and that he had a
private vengeance to serve. His colonel&mdash;one
Sahib Elton&mdash;had insulted and wounded him,
and he wished to deal him a blow that he would
feel. I do not encourage private spites; but I
am obliged to make the most of the only material
that comes to me, and before I heard this
Soubahdar's story, I had judged that he was a
clever soldier, and that I would do well to keep
him. Let my brother listen well," said the rebel
chieftain impressively, "for the strange part of
my story comes in here. The Soubahdar knew
that his enemy had a daughter in the European
station of Nowgong. I had heard, no matter
how"&mdash;I thought that here he glanced up towards
the gallery, and my heart beat angrily&mdash;"that
you had sent in search of her. So I
allowed my Soubahdar to take out a few horsemen
and waylay the Nowgong fugitives."</p>

<p>'He paused. It was with difficulty that I
repressed a movement of indignation; but
remembering that I was entirely in his hands, I
was able to muster sufficient self-control to beg
him to go on with his story. "Did the Soubahdar
succeed in his base attempt?" I asked.</p>

<p>'He would not answer me directly. Here,
indeed, our conversation became so swift and
complicated that I cannot undertake to write it
down accurately. I remember that he pressed
his alliance upon me, and I know that I strenuously
refused to pledge myself to anything
more than the personal friendship and exercise
of influence in case of disaster which I had
already promised him.</p>

<p>'Again and again I tried to surprise him into
making some admission as to the safety of Grace
and Kit, and again and again he evaded me.
At last, having travelled all night, and lived for
some days previously in a state of nerve-tension,
which made rest impossible, I became so much
exhausted that I could scarcely raise my voice
above a whisper.</p>

<p>'By this time the full day had come. It was
a day of storms. As I was led across the court
to the mud-paved room on the ground-storey,
which I am to occupy, the rain beat upon us
pitilessly and the wind howled and tore about
the corners of the fort, till one might have
thought it in danger of destruction.</p>

<p>'I felt that I must sleep if I was to preserve
my senses: there seemed, moreover, to be no
imminent danger to anyone, so I flung myself on
the charpoy which was the only piece of furniture
in the room and closed my eyes.</p>

<p>'The next thing I knew&mdash;and it seemed to me
as if only a moment had gone by since I lay
down&mdash;I was starting up, wide-awake and full
of energy, and Hoosanee was standing beside
me with a strong cup of coffee in one hand and
a dish of chupatties in the other. I took the
little meal gladly. He watched me, looking sad
and reproachful; but when I begged him to give
his opinion of the state of affairs, he put his
finger on his lip and shook his head. It was
then late in the afternoon. I sought and obtained
another interview with Dost Ali Khan; but with
no better result, and now, night having come, I
have returned to my room, and, with Hoosanee
watching beside me, am waiting for those in the
fort to go to rest, as we intend then to look
round us cautiously.</p>

<p>'Ganesh has kept away all day. This, I am
afraid, augurs ill for his faithfulness.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A few words must be added here. I have
them from Hoosanee, who was faithful to his
master throughout this adventure.</p>

<p>Everything was still that night, he said. He
was dozing. His master was keeping himself
awake by writing in his book. They had
determined, towards the small hours of the
morning, to go round the fort themselves. He
had made friends with one of the watchmen,
whose faithfulness had been corrupted by the
present of a valuable trinket, and the promise
of still richer gifts, if he helped them to their
will. What they wished to do was to find out
for certain if Grace and Kit were in the fort,
and, if so, putting off their deliverance until
some good plan could be devised, to encourage
them by letting them know that friends were at
hand.</p>

<p>He, as I have said, had been dozing. Feeling
sure that they ought to be on the move, he
aroused himself. His master put down his book,
and asked him in a whisper to go out and see if
his friend was ready. He crept to the door,
which was ajar, and opened it. In the next
moment he had fallen back upon his master,
dazed and trembling.</p>

<p>The doorway was blocked up by a slender
figure in shining raiment with the face covered,
and naturally his first thought was that Dost Ali
Khan, repenting of his treachery, had sent them
his captive. But Tom knew better. The moment
he saw the figure he sprang to his feet with a
wrathful expression. Hoosanee, thinking from
the emotion in his voice and manner that some
new danger assailed them, looked to him for directions;
but Tom motioned him away. 'This is
an Englishwoman, but not the one we seek,' he
said in Marathi. 'Remain in the room, but keep
at a little distance from us.'</p>

<p>Of the interview that followed no record remains.
Tom could not be prevailed upon to
speak of it. It is not so much as mentioned in
his diary. Hoosanee, whose confidence in his
master was perfect, neither understood nor sought
to understand what was going on. Fearing
treachery, however, he held himself on the alert,
and when, after having poured herself out in a
torrent of impassioned words, Vivien, for the
figure could have been none other, rushed out
into the darkness, he was by his master's side
in a moment. To his dismay he found him
weak and trembling. Twice, it seemed to
him, that he was trying to speak, but he said
nothing.</p>

<p>Then Hoosanee told him that the night was
passing, and urged him to lose no time in setting
forth upon their task. The friendly Watchman
was outside. He had won over all those who
were watching with him. If they did not at
once seize their opportunity, it would pass out
of their hands for ever.</p>

<p>But if his master's manner had dismayed
him, he was still more alarmed by the way in
which his advice was taken. For an instant
Tom made as if he would follow him, and then
he sat down and burst into a passion of tears.</p>

<p>Hoosanee was in an agony. What had
happened? 'Is Missy Grace dead?' he whispered,
going quite close to his master.</p>

<p>'No, no; I hope to God she is alive still,'
said Tom. 'And if I knew that the Jezebel who
has just gone was speaking the truth, I should
not be like this. I should know, at least, what
to attempt. But how am I to tell? She may
be lying to me as she lied to her husband, as she
is lying every day to Dost Ali Khan.'</p>

<p>'What has she told my master?' asked
Hoosanee.</p>

<p>'She says that they were here, and that they
have gone. She heard I was coming and she put
them out. She had made up her mind that we
should not meet. Curses&mdash;a thousand curses&mdash;on
her head!'</p>

<p>'Why did she tell my master this?' said
Hoosanee.</p>

<p>'She did not tell me at first. It came
out. That is why I think it may be true. She
was enraged that I would not do what she
wished, and then she threw it in my teeth. If I
believed her, and escaped as I might do, and if
I found out afterwards that she had lied to me&mdash;or
if, on the other hand, I remained here while
they were going through danger and hardship
outside&mdash;oh! Hoosanee&mdash;my brother, advise me!
What shall I do?'</p>

<p>'Listen, my master,' said the good fellow,
who, while his master had been speaking, had
taken his own measure of the situation. 'You
will stay here for an hour. Yes. I beseech you,
do as I say! It will be best. Alone no one will
suspect me. I will join my friend, the chowkedar,
and go with him on his rounds. I will
hear the last news of the place. If the prisoners
are still here, or if they have been put out, as
the White Ranee says, will soon be known to me.
When I know, I will return to my master, and
he will decide what we had best do.'</p>

<p>It seemed the most feasible plan. In any
case, so Hoosanee has told me, it was adopted.
He left his master, hoping that he would compose
himself in his absence, and went out into
the court. The first person he met was Ganesh.
Ganesh looked wild and unnatural. Hoosanee
stopped for a moment to tax him with treachery.
The Brahmin threw back the word in his teeth,
and they parted. Ganesh went to the door of
their master's room. Hoosanee joined the friendly
chowkedar. They were smoking a pipe together,
and the bearer was gradually drawing out
the information he required, when in the courtyard
there was a sudden clamour. One of the
sentinels, posted outside, came rushing in breathless
with the news that the Gora-log or European-folk
were upon them. The chowkedar sprang
up and ran headlong to the quarter of the fort
where Dost Ali Khan and his captains were
sleeping, and Hoosanee made at full speed for
his master's room. Ganesh was there before
him, so the young rajah had already heard of the
panic. He was standing up fully dressed, with a
revolver in one hand and a sword in the other,
and Ganesh was beseeching him to remain where
he was. 'We may escape,' he said, 'if we remain
where we are. If we go out amongst them
we are doomed.'</p>

<p>'But the prisoners!' cried Tom, who must
have been nearly beside himself.</p>

<p>'If they are in the fort&mdash;' began Ganesh.</p>

<p>'They are not&mdash;they are not,' shrieked
Hoosanee.</p>

<p>'The chief thinks so, but he is mistaken. The
Soubahdar Sufder Jung was ordered yesterday
by the White Ranee to take them away.'</p>

<p>'The Soubahdar Sufder Jung!' echoed Tom,
and his arms dropped from his hands, and his
limbs seemed to fail under him. 'The Soubahdar
Sufder Jung!'</p>

<p>'Courage, Excellency!' said Ganesh. 'He
has done it in the hope of reward.'</p>

<p>'Reward? Vengeance!' cried the unfortunate
young fellow. 'Here! For God's sake
let me out! I will kill that fiend with my own
hands; I will force her to tell me the truth.
Ganesh&mdash;Hoosanee, wretches! what do you
mean? Have you turned against me too? Loose
me, or I will slay you both!'</p>

<p>'Let my lord have patience!' murmured
Hoosanee.</p>

<p>'Patience?' echoed Tom, with a hoarse laugh.
'There! This is my patience!'</p>

<p>With one mighty effort he had thrown them
off. They lay on the ground&mdash;stunned by the
force with which they had fallen. Tom picked
up his weapons and bounded, like a wild creature
escaped from captivity, across the room. For a
few moments they lost him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Hoosanee came to himself, the room
was empty. He had fallen with more force than
Ganesh, who had already followed his master,
and he had not the least idea how long he had
been insensible. It would have been natural for
the good fellow, who was conscious of nothing
but devotion and rectitude, to be indignant at
the treatment he had received; but it was not
so. Sorrow and compassion for his master, with
shame that he could not hold him back from
what, enlightened by a few awful words from
Ganesh, would, he believed, be his destruction,
made up the whole of his feeling. His head
had struck violently against a corner of the
charpoy as he fell, and, with recovered consciousness,
came violent pain. He raised himself with
difficulty to a sitting posture, crept to the door
and looked out.</p>

<p>The confusion had not ceased. From every
hole and corner armed men were hurrying out
to man the walls, and there came, from a little
distance, the rattle of musketry. There was
another sound&mdash;more awful in its significance&mdash;the
dull boom of cannon, and the crash of falling
masonry. But it was not for this that the
unarmed, terror-stricken man was listening. It
was not to hear this that he laid his ear upon
the ground. Ha! what is that? He springs to
his feet, gazes into the lurid, torch-lit enclosure,
and then, putting his hands to his mouth, trumpet-wise,
shrieks out, 'Fly! fly! The magazine
is undermined.' The words act like magic. In
less than a moment the court is full of flying
figures. There is a subterranean exit. The
Europeans will not discover it in the darkness.
Hundreds fling themselves into it, casting away
their weapons, and hundreds are crushed out of
all similitude of men. But, amongst the flying
figures, Hoosanee does not see those whom he
seeks. There comes to his ear a low rumble,
and he flings himself down with his face to the
ground. In the next instant the earth seems to
rock like a drunken man, and there is a sound
mightier far than the roll of artillery or the
thunder of a storm. Crash! crash! A wild
shriek! a low, piteous wailing! Another crash
as the masonry gives way, hurling down those
who had been defending it into the trenches, men
no longer now. A splinter strikes Hoosanee as
he lies, and his lips part in a groan. If he is not
in safety here, what must <i>their</i> fate be? And is
this&mdash;is this&mdash;to be the end of all his hopes?
Has he been deceived all along? Was the master
he served as the true representative of him who
had gone but a simulacrum and no true man?
Surely, if what he had so fondly believed was
true, <i>they</i> would not have suffered him to perish
thus! Such were the ideas that were thronging
his troubled brain in those dreadful moments.
How many they were he could never tell. He
plucked up courage to look up presently. The
court was deserted. Where the rebel chief's
vast magazine and treasure-house of arms and
gold had been, a column of flame and smoke was
rising into the air. The buildings adjacent to
it&mdash;one of which, as he knew, was Dost Ali
Khan's house&mdash;were beginning to burn. The
boom of artillery had ceased&mdash;there was no need
for it now; but from outside he could hear the
clatter of arms, and he knew that, in a short
time, the fort would be taken by assault. In such
case what would their fate be&mdash;his own&mdash;Ganesh's&mdash;his
master's&mdash;if he was still alive? Might
they not be killed by the angry English soldiers,
before they could make themselves known?</p>

<p>Deeper and deeper grew the silence about
him. Those who were not dead or wounded
had crowded into the subterranean exit. It
would be strange, thought Hoosanee, if the
English soldiers were to come in presently and
find only him.</p>

<p>The torches that had lit the courtyard had
died down. There was nothing now to illuminate
it but the fiery column. By its light he
saw dimly three figures, that seemed to come
out miraculously from the very heart of the
burning mass. He ran forward with a cry. If
this was his master, then everything was true,
for not Rama himself could boast such an adventure!
The Divine Ones had cared for their
own.</p>

<p>'Hoosanee!' That was the rajah's voice.</p>

<p>'Master,' he cried piteously. 'Are you
safe?'</p>

<p>'I am safe. Take this burden from me!'</p>

<p>It was the form, to all appearance lifeless, of
a woman. Hoosanee received it into his arms
and, followed by Tom and Ganesh, who were
nearly exhausted, carried it into the hut and
laid it down on the charpoy.</p>

<p>'Light my lamp!' said Tom. 'Now,' he
went on, 'go out, both of you, and wait for me.'</p>

<p>They obeyed, and he was left alone with the
lifeless form. The face was covered with a veil.
He lifted it and gazed down. Yes, it was Vivien
Doncaster. Vivien herself&mdash;the soft brow&mdash;the
smiling lips&mdash;the merry dimples! The horror of
death, which had been swift and sudden, had
changed her no more than the horror of guilt
in which she had steeped herself. Fair, sweet,
innocent, like a sleeping child, she lay before
him on the pillow.</p>

<p>With a shudder he dropped the veil. 'Farewell,
beautiful witch,' he murmured: 'we meet
for the last time. That it was not left to me to
kill you, I thank God; but I would not, if I
could, bring you back to the life which you
have so miserably abused. Farewell! As you
lived, so you die&mdash;a torment and a mystery.'</p>

<p>As he spoke, he took a letter from his pocket,
twisted it into a match, and, having kindled it at
the lamp, deliberately set fire to the charpoy in
two or three places.</p>

<p>Looking up then, he saw Hoosanee beside
him. 'What is it?' he said angrily. 'I thought
I told you to remain outside.'</p>

<p>'Master,' answered Hoosanee, 'the English
soldiers are coming in through the breach. If
we do not wish to die, we must stand aside until
you can see the General.'</p>

<p>'You are right, as usual, my good Hoosanee,'
said Tom, with his usual mildness. 'Ganesh
knows the place, he will hide us.'</p>

<p>As they left the hut the flames ran up, consuming
the charpoy and the dead body, and no
one knew till much later that a human body had
been within the charred and ruined hut.</p>

<p>To the servants, who had been witnesses of
the deed, it was a deed of charity. Whatever
the dead woman had been, the flames that made
her sepulchre were less cruel far than the hands
of men would be.</p>

<h5><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV</a></h5>

<h4>GOING THROUGH THE LAND&mdash;FROM NORTH TO SOUTH,
FROM EAST TO WEST</h4>


<p>Morning dawned upon the ruin of the fort.
Where Dost Ali Khan's magazine, the storehouse
from which he drew his supplies, had
been, there was a wide breach. Outside, English
and Sikh soldiers&mdash;a detachment from the main
army, which was on its way to Cawnpore&mdash;were
under arms, waiting to rush in with the first
rays of daylight. They were exultant, for this
stronghold of the rebel chieftain, which was so
cleverly hidden away that they had only discovered
it by accident, was a refuge and a tower
of strength to the mutineers, and without it the
cleverest and most influential of their opponents,
if he had escaped, would be completely paralysed.
It was more than probable, however, that he
would himself share in the destruction of the
fort, in which case a blow would have been
struck whose effects were incalculable.</p>

<p>In the night, and before they were discovered,
they had thrown a cordon round the building,
to cut off the escape of the garrison, which they
had reason to believe was numerous. Hundreds
fell with the magazine, while the guns, plied as
they had been in the dark, had doubtless done
some execution; but they could not suppose
that everyone within the walls had been slain,
and the complete silence puzzled them.</p>

<p>Fearing an ambush, they set to work
cautiously. The officers were to the front as
usual, and Bertie Liston was one of the first to
leap over the mounds of rubbish that blocked
up the breach and to alight within the boundaries
of the fort.</p>

<p>His presence at this critical moment must be
explained.</p>

<p>When we saw him last he was leaving
Gumilcund under the convoy of Subdul Khan, to
make the best of his way to Meerut, which, however,
he did not reach, having been met at a few
leagues distance from the station by a runner in
disguise, carrying despatches from the General
at Meerut to the General of the army of relief,
with a peremptory order to himself to use his
utmost diligence to find the army, and to offer
his services to the chiefs who, it was rumoured,
had lost some of their officers by fever and other
casualties.</p>

<p>Nothing, as we shall imagine, could have
been more congenial to Bertie, who, ever since
he heard the terrible news from Jhansi, had
been longing ardently for a brush with the
rebels. Helped by Subdul Khan, whose ability
and devotion were beyond praise, he succeeded
in finding the head quarters of the army. On
his way, through a series of accidents, which
there is not space to record here, he discovered
the whereabouts of Dost Ali Khan's fort, and
when a body of troops of all arms were detached
to capture it, he was given the command of the
cavalry. And so it came about strangely that
the first face Tom saw that day was the face of
a friend.</p>

<p>All need for disguise being, for the moment,
over, he had thrown aside the turban which he
habitually wore, and washed the dye from his
face, which was fearfully haggard and as pale as
death.</p>

<p>With his two servants behind him, he was
standing in one of the covered enclosures that
still remained intact, when Bertie, walking in
advance of his soldiers, with his drawn sword
in his right hand, and his left grasping his
revolver, marched by. He saw him, recognised
him in an instant, and, breaking into an exclamation
of surprise, called upon his men to halt.</p>

<p>Tom joined him, smiling sadly. 'I am afraid
you will find nothing but ruins here,' he said.
'The few who were left of the garrison escaped.'
Then he pointed to his two men. 'They are
my servants. They will be safe?'</p>

<p>'Perfectly. I will leave two or three men to
guard them in case of mistakes. We are fearfully
savage.'</p>

<p>'God knows I can understand that. Come
on! I will lead you,' said Tom.</p>

<p>'But how do you come to be here?'</p>

<p>'I came to find Miss Elton. She was taken
prisoner.'</p>

<p>'Good God!' cried Bertie. 'You don't mean
to tell me&mdash;Heavens, man!&mdash;what a fright you
gave me! A prisoner? Not here, surely?'</p>

<p>'I hope not. I hope not. And yet&mdash;good
heavens! what am I saying? I know for certain
that she came here. I was told, only just
before the alarm, that she was sent away&mdash;sent
away with a soubahdar, who had a grudge
against her father. It may be false&mdash;God in
heaven grant that it is.'</p>

<p>'His name?' said Bertie, his brow darkening.</p>

<p>'Sufder Jung. Do you know anything about
him?'</p>

<p>'Only that he was one of General Elton's
pets.'</p>

<p>'The General wounded him,' said Tom, 'and
he came here, vowing vengeance. I have it
from Dost Ali Khan, who allowed him to seize
Miss Elton and bring her here. She was one of
my Nowgong fugitives&mdash;my servant had rescued
them. They were within a day's march of Gumilcund.
The others came in&mdash;&mdash;' His voice
broke.</p>

<p>'Hold up, old man!' said Bertie huskily.
'Do you mean to tell me that Dost Ali Khan
gave her up?'</p>

<p>'No; I believe he meant well. He had sent
for me. He was making her a bait for my alliance.
I could not have given in to that, of
course; but I don't think for a moment that
he would have hurt her. I can't tell you everything
now. It was one of their fiendish intrigues.'
As they talked they were going round the fort,
where not a soul was to be found but these
three men&mdash;the Rajah of Gumilcund and his two
servants.</p>

<p>'Can the brutes have got away?' said Bertie.</p>

<p>Tom sent for Ganesh, who, he said, knew
more of the events of the night than either he
or Hoosanee, and, after a little delay, the
Brahmin led them to a small inner courtyard, in
the centre of which was a dry well. Several of
the men who were following them leapt down.
They found nothing but dead bodies. The entrance
to the subterranean passage, which made
a secret exit from the fort, was here, and hundreds
had been smothered in their efforts to
reach it. That some had escaped was most
probable; but whether the chief was amongst
them or not could not be determined. Search
was made for his body, but it was not found.
This was the only damper on an enterprise
which had been perfectly successful, and accomplished
without the loss of a single life.</p>

<p>The soldiers were now allowed to rest, cook
their morning meal, and ransack the ruins for
such treasures as might have escaped the destruction
that had fallen upon the fort, and
Tom, whose story had run through the camp,
was invited to the officers' mess. Ganesh and
Hoosanee, meanwhile, were taking what rest and
refreshment they could, and making arrangements
for another start. It was well that they
had their wits about them, for Tom, for the
moment, was like one dazed. The colonel of the
detachment, when he had benevolently tried to
enter into conversation with him, congratulating
him on his escape, and asking what measures he
meant to take to ensure his safe return to Gumilcund,
and had received nothing but vague
replies, took Bertie aside, and said that something
ought to be done for the poor fellow. His
mind was evidently a little astray. Bertie had
the same fear; had his duty permitted&mdash;I have
this part of the story from him&mdash;he would
willingly have joined his unfortunate friend,
giving him the benefit of what he considered his
own clearer judgment. But this he knew was
impossible.</p>

<p>He led him away from the mess table. 'My
dear fellow,' he said as firmly as he could, 'you
must really tell me what your plans are. Where
do you mean to go when you leave this place?
To Gumilcund?'</p>

<p>'To Gumilcund! When Grace is wandering
Heaven alone knows where!'</p>

<p>'Do you love her?' asked Bertie, hoping to
rouse him.</p>

<p>'Love!' burst out the poor fellow, 'that is
too poor a word! I&mdash;oh, God! there is no
word&mdash;no word I have ever heard that can
tell what I feel. She is everything to me&mdash;life,
love, hope. I would give myself&mdash;I would die
in slow tortures in the presence of my enemies,
to save her&mdash;my darling&mdash;one moment's uneasiness.
And to think&mdash;but I can't think. Thinking
kills. I must act, or I must die!'</p>

<p>'But have you any clue?' said Bertie. He
was full of the most passionate sympathy, and
he dared not give it vent. His unhappy friend
must be brought to take a practical view of his
position if he was to be saved. 'Couldn't you
tell me how you mean to set about the search?'
he went on.</p>

<p>'I don't know. Don't ask me. Light will
come. My servants are looking for horses.
Give me money, like a good fellow&mdash;all the
money you have. I will return it to you when
we meet in Gumilcund. We shall meet'&mdash;with
a strange smile. 'Yes; don't look at me in that
incredulous way. And she will be there, too;
and, look here, Captain Liston: if you see the
others&mdash;the General, and Lady Elton, and
Trixy&mdash;tell them that I am going through the
land&mdash;from east to west, from north to south&mdash;deserts,
jungles, forests. I will leave no stone
of it all untrodden, and, sooner or later, with
God's good help, I will come upon her&mdash;or'&mdash;in
a terrible whisper&mdash;'her murderers!'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes,' said Bertie chokingly. 'But, my
dear boy, you mustn't be so vague&mdash;you mustn't,
really. You won't find her by riding over the
country, and most likely you will get killed
yourself, which wouldn't suit the book of any of
us just now. I have been putting your scheme
before the General, you know, and he quite falls
in with it&mdash;says you are a military genius.
We shall want you to help us to work it. Take
my advice, and&mdash;&mdash;' He paused. 'The poor
fellow doesn't so much as hear me,' he said to
himself. 'I wonder&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>But at this moment Hoosanee interrupted
them. 'May I have a word with my master?'
he said.</p>

<p>At the sound of his voice Tom started up,
all his lethargy gone. 'Yes, Hoosanee, I have
done with the Sahib,' he said. 'Captain Liston,
good-bye. I trust we may meet in Gumilcund.'</p>

<p>And before Bertie could speak another word
he had gone.</p>

<h4>A BRUSH WITH MUTINEERS AND A CLUE TO THE
FUGITIVES</h4>


<p>Again we must let the Rajah's Heir tell his story
in his own words. The exact date of the following
extracts is not given; but, from internal
evidence, I judge that they were written in the
month of August.</p>

<p>It was a critical time for the country, for rebellion
was still at large, and no decisive step
had been taken to check it; but the gathering
of enormous masses of rebels in and about the
great centres of mutiny, such as Delhi, which
was still in the hands of the disloyal troops, and
Lucknow, where the gallant little band of Europeans
were holding at bay untold hosts of
enemies, and the marching down into Central
India of a Goorkha army from Nepaul, kept the
country districts, over most of which the wave
of insurrection had swept, comparatively free
from disorder. In many places English magistrates
had actually resumed their ordinary jurisdiction,
and, although the mails were subject to interruptions,
and had to travel by a more circuitous
route than formerly, while the robber tribes and
vagrants were more troublesome and insolent to
travellers, it was still possible, even for a European,
with pluck and readiness of wit, to pass
safely through the land. The villagers, moreover,
and scattered peasantry, having seen what
the rule of a disorderly army meant, showed
less animosity against the English. In some few
cases they were actually friendly, while there
can be no doubt that in others they magnified
the difficulties of the road to fugitives to magnify
the reward which they hoped to earn by hiding
them.</p>

<p>Tom travelled, as he had done before, in an
Eastern disguise, and he did not, therefore, undergo
the same perils as his compatriots. But
that his journey was not without its perils this
record will show.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'How many days and nights have gone by
since I left the fort? I cannot tell, and, in fact,
it seems to me sometimes that I have lost the
power of recording time. One day is much the
same as another. But this morning something
happened, and we have decided, in the little
council which we hold daily&mdash;Ganesh and Hoosanee
and I&mdash;that it will be wise to halt in this
village for a few hours. So, to still my impatience,
and to regain, if I can, the balance of
mind which deserted me so strangely after my
awful experiences at the fort, I am trying to put
down upon paper the things that have happened
to us, and the things that we expect. I do not
despair yet. That seems strange, even to my
two devoted servants, who, I can see, though
they do all they can to help me, have themselves
given up hope of anything but disaster. Ganesh
desires me to return to Gumilcund. The days at
the fort have caused him to change his politics,
and he is very sorry now that he carried Dost
Ali Khan's message to me at all. If he only
knew how fervently I thank him in my heart!
for, sad and dispiriting as this life is, I know
very well that at Gumilcund it would have been
worse. Now I have hope, at least. Every
night, as we start on our journeys, I say to myself,
to-morrow morning we shall hear of them!
And I feel that I am doing something.</p>

<p>'It has come to our ears, through one of
Hoosanee's many spies, that a party of rebels,
carrying with them English prisoners, will pass
through this village to-day, and we have reasons
for thinking that Grace and Kit may be amongst
them. If they are&mdash;but I dare scarcely think of
it. The thought unnerves me.</p>

<p>'It has gone round that I am a great man&mdash;not
a rajah&mdash;I dare not give myself that title
lest I should be detained&mdash;but an Ameer of
great wealth. How Hoosanee manages Heaven
only knows: his resource and readiness are marvellous:
but he always keeps me provided with
good mounts, fine trappings for the horses, and
fresh garments. I second his efforts as well as I
can by preserving, in my face and manner, the
dignity of a king's envoy, and we meet with
respect everywhere. In this large and populous
village, I have been given the whole of the serai
to myself, and the chief men amongst the villagers
have brought beds and padded quilts, and
water and food for my entertainment. We
arrived between night and morning. It is full
noon now&mdash;the awful, burning noon of this
terrible season. I occupy a pavilion lifted high
above the court of the serai. Ever since early
morning the people of the village have been
crowding in to see me; but, thank Heaven, the
heat has driven them away at last. While my
good Hoosanee prowls about, picking up what
information he can, and Ganesh is making
arrangements for our further supplies, I can
draw down my blinds and rest.</p>

<p>'I have slept&mdash;actually slept. I dreamt that
we were together again in England, Grace and
I. Is this a good omen? God grant it. Hoosanee,
who has just been in, tells me that he has
gained over the villagers. They will not attempt
to fight the rebel escort, but if the sepoys halt
here for a few hours, as it is supposed they will
do, it is proposed to take the prisoners from them
by subtlety. He asked what I would promise
them, and I left him free to make any conditions
he pleased. I think he has been obliged to tell
more than he intended, for I hear a great buzz
as of many voices in the serai, and I can see
through my blinds that the people are gathering
together in their multitudes. If they will have
me as a leader I am ready to put myself at their
head. Ah! how my heart bounds as I think of
it! Once&mdash;once to see myself face to face
with these villains! But we must be prudent.
We must remember Cawnpore. Subtlety first,
till the captives are in our hands, and then
force!'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'It is all over! Not for me, for my task
is not done; yet, sad and hopeless as I feel,
there is in my soul a certain wild springing up
of exultation which prevents me from being
utterly cast down. It is for them&mdash;for the
torturers of women and the slaughterers of unarmed
men and helpless children&mdash;that the end
has come. Fifty rebel sepoys with their leader
lie slain in the narrow streets of this quiet village.
Their prisoners&mdash;two young English officers,
fearfully attenuated, who had been walking
under the sun of this August day with chains
on their limbs, and a lady in a cart whose face I
have not seen, though I know to my sorrow that
she is not Grace&mdash;are under the care of my excellent
Hoosanee in the house of the headman of
the village.</p>

<p>'How did it all come about? This I must try
to remember and put down. That we&mdash;the
assailants of this valiant fifty&mdash;were only about
twelve men all told I know, for Hoosanee counted
them out before me. It was a fortunate circumstance
for us that we had anyone at all to help
us, for the villagers, though sympathetic and
willing to earn the large reward I offered, had no
wish to put their skins in jeopardy by trying
conclusions with armed and disciplined soldiers.
But, as it happened, a little band of Bheels, on
their way to fill up the gaps made daily by sword
and pestilence in one of the newly formed native
regiments, were halting in the village, and some
of these were ready to flesh their swords on the
persons of the hated Poorbeahs to whom, as
Hoosanee had represented, the English prisoners'
escort belonged.</p>

<p>'They marched in early in the evening. The
village was complaisant, and an enormous
quantity of food, with good liquor to wash it
down, was brought to them, while the serai
which I had vacated was allotted to them for the
long rest that would be sure to follow their
heavy meal. They entered and disposed themselves
for sleep, sentinels being posted at every
entrance to give notice of danger. Night fell.
My few men and I were close by, watching.
The sentinels, who had feasted as luxuriously
as their comrades, kept on the alert for a short
time, and then, seeing that everything was quiet,
addressed themselves to sleep. Some of our
friends amongst the villagers slipped in softly, set
the prisoners free and brought them out, whereupon
our little body of sturdy hill-men ran into
the serai with shouts and the fierce clattering of
arms. From outside these shouts were echoed
by the villagers, and the unhappy wretches in
the serai, thinking, no doubt, that an army was
upon them, were completely paralysed. Numbers
were slain. The remainder rushed out. It was
deep night now, and they could not see the
number of their assailants. I stood at the
entrance alone, and I cut them down one after
the other. God forgive me if I sinned, not in
killing, but in the awful spirit of exultation which
possessed me as I plied my fearful task. Ten
men must have fallen to my sword. Some who
had caught up their weapons in their abject
flight tried to resist me, but I was too swift for
them. I was not a man, I was an avenging fate.
Those who escaped me fell into the hands of the
villagers, and they, with yells of derision, drove
them back into the serai, so that in a brief hour
it was all over. Every one of the rebel escort
was slain, and their prisoners&mdash;who, we hear,
were to have been taken to Lucknow and there
most foully put to death&mdash;are safe in our hands.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'The exultation which followed my easy
victory did not last long. What does the
slaughter of one or two matter in this great
saturnalia of blood and wretchedness? Grace
has not been found, and till my hair turns grey,
and my limbs wither from age and disappointment,
I will search for her. So we&mdash;Hoosanee,
Ganesh, and I&mdash;are on the march again. The
little party of prisoners is left in the village. I
was surprised and deeply touched to find that
the lady in the cart was Mrs. Lyster, my
travelling friend of the "Patagonia." She and
her companions, supposing me to be a native
potentate who had interfered in their behalf, sent
as soon as the struggle was over to thank me for
their rescue, and to beg for the favour of an
interview. I sent back word by Hoosanee, who
was their messenger, that I would wait upon
them, and, dressed as usual in my Indian disguise,
I entered the inner court of the headman's house
where they were resting.</p>

<p>'I had resolved not to make myself known
as an Englishman, but the sight of Mrs. Lyster's
sorrowful face and neglected dress&mdash;she who had
always been so gay and trim!&mdash;was almost too
much for my resolution. It gave me a little
pang to find that she had not the least suspicion
of my being anything but what I gave myself
out to be; and how strange it was to me to
receive her humble thanks! Evidently she had
been chosen to speak, for the young fellows with
her were too much exhausted to be capable of
carrying on a conversation. Sad as it all was,
I could have smiled at her careful speech. She
had never been very strong in Hindostani, and
she was fearful of not speaking to the great
Indian lord in a sufficiently respectful manner.
Over and over again I longed to turn everyone
out, and to speak to her in our own English
tongue. But this I knew would have been the
height of imprudence.</p>

<p>'I hope I replied becomingly to her thanks.</p>

<p>'And now came the question of what they
were to do next. They wished to reach, as soon
as possible, a place where they could feel themselves
secure, and I was anxious to have them in
Gumilcund with my other fugitives; but I could
not, even for their sakes, give up my search, and
I was afraid of allowing them to travel alone.
The two young men, moreover, who as I presently
found out were subalterns in the army,
and mere boys, were so much prostrated by the
hardships they had undergone that to take them
on at once might have endangered their lives.
Mrs. Lyster told with tears that one of them had
been tied to a tree in a village through which
they had passed, and flogged in the presence of
a hooting crowd of villagers, and that both of
them had been put in irons and forced to walk
for miles under the burning sun. Taking all
these things into consideration, we thought it
best that they should run the risk of staying
where they were for a few days. I, in the
meantime, would send messengers to Gumilcund,
which was within three days' march of the
village, and an escort strong enough to take
them there safely would be sent out.</p>

<p>'Mrs. Lyster showed some animation when
Gumilcund was mentioned.</p>

<p>'"I have heard of the little State as one of the
happiest and quite the most wisely governed in
India. Are you," looking at me doubtfully,
"the Rajah?"</p>

<p>'I drew back from the light and put on all
my dignity. "Madam," I said, bowing low, "I
have at least great influence in Gumilcund, and
that, with everything else I possess, is at your
service."</p>

<p>'"Everything, except your Excellency's
time," said Mrs. Lyster, with a touch of her old
spirit which enchanted me.</p>

<p>'Keeping myself well in hand, I made another
ceremonious reverence. "My gracious lady
must know," I said, "that my time is not my
own. If it were, she would be welcome to it."</p>

<p>'"To whom does your Highness's time
belong?" she asked.</p>

<p>'"To the God whom I have worshipped from
my birth," I answered. "I will speak to you
frankly, for you are of those who can understand.
I have bound myself under a solemn vow to find
and rescue an English lady from whom I have
received many kindnesses."</p>

<p>'"Is she in danger?" asked Mrs. Lyster.</p>

<p>'"I have reason to believe so," I answered.</p>

<p>'"A prisoner? English?" she asked eagerly.</p>

<p>'For an instant I forgot everything, and if
Hoosanee, who was always on the watch for
these mistakes, had not interposed, I should
certainly have betrayed myself by dashing into
English. Bowing himself almost to the ground,
he stepped forward.</p>

<p>'"Will my master pardon me?" he said. "I
have a question to ask the Mem Sahib."</p>

<p>'"Say on, Hoosanee," I said, withdrawing into
the shadow, and letting him continue the conversation.
I did not, in fact, speak again&mdash;a
circumstance which annoyed Mrs. Lyster, for
when, Hoosanee having obtained all the information
she could give us, we retreated to the
courtyard, I heard her say, in English, "He is
the nicest native I ever met. But what a pity
to see him so completely in the power of that
deceitful-looking servant!" I thought, as I
crossed the court, how, if God spares us to see
some of this dreadful tangle straight, Mrs. Lyster
and I will laugh over it by-and-by.</p>

<p>'We saw our host, who was perfectly agreeable,
vowing, by all he held sacred, that the
fugitives whom the courage of his lords had
rescued should be well treated while they were
in the village.</p>

<p>'Ganesh now came in, and informed us before
him that my letters had been sent to Gumilcund.
These were to Chunder Singh and Lutfullah,
requesting that men and money should be sent
to the village at once. The money was to
reward those who had stood by us. The men
were to escort Mrs. Lyster and her companions
to Gumilcund. When he heard of soldiers and
treasure, the headman became more and more
abject. I believe he will be loyal. Fortunately,
no one of the prisoners' escort is left to tell the
tale of their destruction to the rebel army.</p>

<p>'This over, we retired to the hut that had
been allotted to me, and discussed our further
proceedings, which were to be moulded on the
information given to Hoosanee by Mrs. Lyster,
and which, with the object of seeing things
more clearly, for I am still like one wandering
in a maze, I shall write down here.</p>

<p>'It was by the merest chance that it all
happened. For the latter part of their miserable
journey&mdash;it had lasted a week when we rescued
them&mdash;she had been given a small covered
bullock-cart, such as native women travel in.
At the last stage, when a halt was called, the
cart was drawn into what seemed to her to be
a large market-place. It was mid-day, she said,
and their escort and the people of the village
where they were halting appeared to be asleep,
for there was no noise. She tried to sleep too.
She thinks she did drop into a doze; but she
always slept with one ear open, and the sound of
low whispering close under the cart aroused her.
One of the side curtains was lifted, and a face
peered in. It was not an angry face. It was
an inquisitive face. The face withdrew, and
another took its place. This one gazed at her
with considerably more attention. But it, too,
withdrew. She was now thoroughly awake,
and a little startled. She crept to the side of
the cart where she had seen the faces, and laid
her ear against the curtain. An altercation was
going on. Words that might be rendered in
English as, "She is!" "She is not!" "I'm certain,"
"So am I;" "You are a fool!" "I'm not:
you are!" were being bandied from mouth to
mouth. All she could gather at first was that
both of the men had thought they recognised
her, and that they did not take her to be the
same person. But why this interest? She continued
to listen, and it seemed to her presently
that the man who spoke in negatives had convinced
his companion. His name was Tikaram.
When they settled down to confidential talk, she
heard him say distinctly that he was in search of
an English girl and a fair-haired boy, who, he
was led to believe, had been taken prisoners by
Dost Ali Khan. A third man joined the conference,
who, from the way in which he spoke,
she judged to be a disarmed and fugitive sepoy.
He was working his way into Nepaul, and
appeared to be in great dread of the swamps
that have to be crossed before the mountain
kingdom is reached. In the course of conversation
he mentioned having heard of English fugitives
going that way.</p>

<p>'I can write of it calmly now&mdash;too calmly&mdash;for
I am becoming accustomed to cruel shocks,
and my heart, I think, is growing callous; but,
when I heard it first, when I tried to realise that
my tender and delicate Grace might be entangled
in the meshes of the pestilential, tiger-haunted
district which I had crossed in the winter, my
heart, I confess, nearly failed me.</p>

<p>'But to return. On hearing of fugitives,
Tikaram roused himself and asked for particulars.
The conversation became very swift now, so that
Mrs. Lyster could not quite follow it; but she is
certain that the sepoy convinced Tikaram of the
identity of the fugitives of whom he had heard
with those he was seeking. He went off presently
in search of an ekka with a swift pony,
and returned to bid his friends good-bye. Mrs.
Lyster thinks that the sepoy joined him, but of
this she cannot be quite sure. She believes,
however, that their designs were friendly.</p>

<p>'Now this, it will be said, was not much to go
upon, but we have to make the best we can of it,
for we have no other clue. Hoosanee builds much,
I find, on Tikaram's name. This Tikaram, if he
is the same man, was a servant in the house
where Grace was staying at Nowgong, and seems
to have been deeply attached to her. There was
besides some whisper of a reward if he could
bring her safely out of Nowgong. The mystery
lies in his knowing that she is not with the other
fugitives at Gumilcund. Hoosanee says that he
advised him not to follow them out of Nowgong,
but it is quite possible that he may have been
upon their heels and have witnessed the capture
of Grace and Kit. Conjecture, however, is of
little use. We have determined in any case to
follow Tikaram, and early in the morning of the
day after the rescue we made a forced march to
the village where Mrs. Lyster and her friends
halted last. There, Hoosanee being as clever as
usual in picking up news, we heard that Tikaram
had been heard of at Ghazeapore. That district
is comparatively quiet, as my good friends the
Ghoorkas, under their gallant captain, Gambier
Singh, are holding Azimgurh in force. It would
be curious if Grace could have wandered so far,
but Hoosanee says it is not at all impossible.
Since the day when she was said to have been
put out of the fort held by Dost Ali Khan more
than three weeks have gone by. I tremble as
I write the words. I scarcely dare to credit
them. Three weeks! She may have died long
since. If she is alive still&mdash;Ah! I cannot write!
I cannot think! God help me! Let me preserve
my reason, at least until I know! Then do with
me as Thou wilt. I will be dumb!'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'Three more days of rapid travelling have
gone by. We are going night and day. When
our horses are knocked up Hoosanee, by some
miraculous means only known to himself, gets
us fresh ones. He tells me that he is drawing
largely upon the future. Let him! So long as we
are moving&mdash;so long as I have still this little ray
of hope to carry me on&mdash;I care for nothing else.</p>

<p>'We are resting in a small dak bungalow on
the banks of a canal, which was occupied I
suppose formerly by an English engineer, and
which is within a few hours' ride of Azimgurh.
I wished to ride on without drawing rein, but
our horses gave in altogether, and we find that
we must let them rest for a few hours. I write
because I dare not think. Every day my love
and agony seem to increase, and I feel sometimes
as if I could not bear it much longer. In
spite of the fatigue we are undergoing, I am
afraid to sleep, for the dreams that haunt me
are worse than my waking thoughts. Oh, what
horror! What misery! Talk of the hideous
visions of a maniac! They can be nothing to
mine. Time after time my good Hoosanee has
come with tears and cried out to me to awake,
for he could not bear to hear my sobs.</p>

<p>'We have heard of Tikaram again. I trust
indeed that we are almost on his heels. He
seems to have visited Azimgurh. Some one heard
that he was given a little band of Ghoorka
soldiers to help him in his search. If that is so,
he must have made Gambier Singh very sure of
his good will. I shall hear all about it presently
from himself.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'I feel as if I ought to have been far from
this hours ago. It is Gambier Singh's fault that
I am not. He has beguiled me to remain by
the promise of such help as it would not be
prudent of me to refuse. I have slept for two
good hours: such a sleep as I have not known
since I left Gumilcund: and now, while the
last preparations for our march are being made,
I will write down in my book the strange events
of yesterday.</p>

<p>'I had no difficulty in finding the head-quarters
of the fine little Ghoorka army; my difficulty was
in having speech of their captain. Fortunately,
however, while I was standing at one of the outposts
begging that a note from me might be
taken in to him, there passed by a man who had
often seen me during my visit to Jung Bahadour
at Katmandoo. He ran in with my note, and in
ten minutes' time Gambier Singh himself appeared
upon the scene. I shall never forget the
warmth of his welcome, or the passionate sympathy
and interest with which he threw himself
into the history of my misfortunes. I really
think he almost regretted for a moment the responsible
position he occupied, which prevented
him from joining me in my search.</p>

<p>'We held a long and earnest consultation. I
find that the rumour concerning Tikaram is true.
He came to the camp with his story, which was
that he was in search of a young Englishwoman
and a child with long fair hair, travelling as it
was supposed alone, who had been heard of
last in these districts, and were said to be
making for Nepaul. He wished to follow and
help her; but his resources were completely
exhausted, he had no arms, and he feared to
penetrate the jungle alone. So Gambier Singh
gave him a body of trusty men to accompany
him. This happened yesterday only, so we shall
soon be on their track.'</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h5><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI</a></h5>

<h4>IN THE DEADLY TERAI</h4>


<p>This part of my friend's diary ends abruptly.
During the next few days it was impossible for
him to write a line, and afterwards he only mentioned
briefly the incidents of his further adventures.
But Hoosanee, Gambier Singh and others,
with whom I have spoken since, have given me
the details so fully that I can almost see the
story passing before my eyes.</p>

<p>I take it up from the point where the diary
breaks off. The writing was interrupted by
Gambier Singh, who came in to tell him that
everything was ready for a start. The Ghoorka
captain had not much hope himself of a happy
issue to the enterprise. He had lost too many
men in the deadly Terai not to know its perils,
and he did not for one moment imagine that a
tender woman and delicate child would have
been able to cross it safely. But he was too
chivalrous and kind of nature to be able to
quench his friend's hopes by expressing his
own conviction. He expended his sympathy in
taking care that nothing which he could supply
should be wanting to the success of the enterprise.</p>

<p>Tom was attended now as befitted a person
of rank. He rode in front on a splendid little
Arab horse&mdash;the gift of Gambier Singh&mdash;a small
body of Ghoorka soldiers, armed to the teeth,
followed him, and close in the rear came camels
and bullock-carts, laden with camp equipage.</p>

<p>For two days and nights they plodded on.
As the jungle closed round them, and the air
grew dark and pestilential, the despondency of
the young rajah increased. Day after day, to
the imminent peril of his life, he left the beaten
tracks and made great circuits in the bush.
Now and then, at such times, he came upon
sights that would make his blood run cold&mdash;human
bones bleaching in the sun, the bodies of
men, who seemed to be sepoys, half gnawed
away by wild beasts, and arms and utensils flung
down in the bush. Once, emerging from a close
thicket, he came upon a huge tiger, mumbling
over its horrid feast. His blood was up, and,
while the restless fire of the brute's fierce eyes
was upon him, it fell, mortally wounded, over
the corpse it had been devouring. His men,
several of whom were close by, were triumphant,
and the beautiful monster was carried off to
camp. As for the conqueror, he turned away
groaning&mdash;penetrated to the heart by a sickness
for which earth holds no remedy.</p>

<p>It was a sickness of the soul, for his bodily
health did not suffer. While one after another
of his attendants sickened, and had to be sent
back, he held on. Even Ganesh, desperately
anxious as he was to keep up, was compelled to
give in at last. Hoosanee, although his superb
devotion prevented him from acknowledging it,
showed, by the wild look in his eyes, that he was
suffering from fever. Tom saw it all; but he
would not give in. 'Let us at least find
Tikaram!' he said to Hoosanee. 'We know
that he has gone into this place. Sooner or
later we must come upon his track. He is not
alone as they are.'</p>

<p>One day, as they were plodding slowly on, a
little cavalcade of men and camels and Ghoorka
soldiers, coming from the opposite direction, met
them. On both sides a halt was immediately
called. Tom, who was in front, saw, as the
party opened out, that a litter was being carried
between them. His pulses had begun to beat
so furiously that he could scarcely breathe or
speak, and he motioned that Hoosanee should
speak for him. A few words were exchanged.
He could not hear them for the tumult of his
senses. Then Hoosanee came up. 'Well!' he
said fiercely.</p>

<p>'My master, it is Tikaram. He is dying.'</p>

<p>'If he is <i>dead</i>, he must speak to me,' cried
Tom.</p>

<p>In the next instant he had sprung from his
horse, and was standing beside the litter. He
set aside the curtains and looked in. At the
sight of him, the fever-stricken wretch within,
who had been lying in a kind of trance, seemed
to be galvanised into new life.</p>

<p>'Are you the rajah?' he said feebly. 'You&mdash;promised&mdash;a
lakh of rupees.'</p>

<p>'A lakh!' echoed Tom. 'I tell you that if
you have found them&mdash;if you can guide us to
where they are&mdash;I will make you rich beyond
the dreams of avarice.'</p>

<p>The man gave a deep sigh. 'A lakh!' he
said slowly.</p>

<p>'But tell me! tell me!' said Tom.</p>

<p>'A lakh!' he repeated. 'I could win it yet.
But I am dying.'</p>

<p>'You shall not die. I have medicines with
me and nourishing food. Good God!' He
broke into English in his agitation. 'The man
is going, and he knows something. I read
it in his eyes. Hoosanee, bring me wine or
spirits.'</p>

<p>A strong restorative was brought in a cup,
which Hoosanee put to the lips of the stricken
man. He swallowed a few drops, and his eyes,
which had been closing, opened once more. Tom
was going to speak again; but Hoosanee stopped
him.</p>

<p>'Let me speak, my master,' he said. 'The
life is nearly gone, and flutters like a spent flame.
A breath may put it out.'</p>

<p>'Right!' said Tom. 'Take my place!'</p>

<p>Then, in the silence of both cavalcades,
Hoosanee stooped over the litter. 'Do you know
me, O brother?' he whispered.</p>

<p>'You are the seller of garnets,' answered
Tikaram. 'You came to Nowgong, and the
lotus-eyed trusted you, and you carried her
away.'</p>

<p>'She was taken from me, Tikaram.'</p>

<p>'She was taken from you. I saw it all. I
followed her to the fort, and when the evil-hearted
Soubahdar took her out of the gates&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>He paused. 'Let my brother go on,' said
Hoosanee gently. 'There is no enemy here.
Why did the Soubahdar take the lotus-eyed
forth?'</p>

<p>'The White Ranee commanded him. She was
black of heart and evil. I saw her at the gate,
and she saw me, and her servants, whom she
commanded, caught me by the girdle and would
have slain me, only that the God whom I serve
was my friend. For a night and a day I lay like
one dead, suffering grievously. My strength
came back and I set out in search of her.'</p>

<p>Again his breath failed him; but a few drops
of Hoosanee's potion made him strong enough to
go on with his tale.</p>

<p>'There were two&mdash;the Miss Sahib and the
child. What the Soubahdar would have with
them I knew not. He was known in the villages
about, and I tracked him from place to place;
but was never swift enough to come up with
him. Then I lost him. He had gone out of a
village in the morning, and his prisoners, who
were still alive, were with him. It was thought
that he was taking them to the hill-countries of
the north. But of this I know nothing, save
that they were going north, and that they
travelled by unfrequented ways. After that
village, O brother, I lost him. Some said he was
dead; but his body was not found. Miss Sahib
and the child I lost too; but I went on, seeking
everywhere.'</p>

<p>'Courage!' whispered Hoosanee. 'My master
will make your family rich.'</p>

<p>'I thought I heard of them at last,' he went
on. 'But they were alone, and how could that
be? Where was the Soubahdar who had taken
them from the fort?'</p>

<p>'Could he have deserted them?' said
Hoosanee&mdash;'left them in some jungly place to
be fallen upon by the wild beasts.'</p>

<p>'Why should he do so, O brother, when he
could take them out himself and kill them with
the sword? He is not of my religion. He is a
Moslem. This I said to myself, and my trouble
was great. But the lakh of rupees and the eyes
of the Miss Sahib, who, as my brother knows,
will sometimes smile graciously on her servants,
kept me from going back. I travelled on till I
reached the camp of the Ghoorkas, where I told
my story, and where I was given men and food
to take me on.'</p>

<p>'Is that all?' said Hoosanee, very sadly.
'Has my brother come back unsuccessful?'</p>

<p>'Am I going back?' cried the poor creature,
starting up and locking round with a fierce
glitter in his bloodshot eyes. Pain conquered
him, and he lay back groaning. 'I could stand
and walk no longer,' he moaned, 'and they put
me in this. But they said, "We are going on,
we camp in new ground every day," and I believed
them&mdash;I believed them.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps you <i>are</i> going on,' said Hoosanee
soothingly. 'This country is strange to me.
But tell me, if you can, why you think that
Missy Grace is here.'</p>

<p>'Have you ever seen Miss Sahib's writing?'
said Tikaram.</p>

<p>'My master knows it well. If you have
found anything, show it to me,' cried Hoosanee
eagerly.</p>

<p>Tikaram was too weak to move. 'My right
hand,' he murmured. 'Open it!'</p>

<p>Pulling aside the light covering that was over
him, Hoosanee saw one of his hands rigid, as it
seemed, and firmly closed. He forced it open as
gently as he could, the man's eager eyes following
him wistfully. Tom was close by. He had
heard the last words, and he was trembling from
head to foot with impatience. But he had to
wait while the fingers, cramped with the awful
sickness of the jungle, were slowly and painfully
unclenched. The hand was nearly open at last.
They saw a scrap of paper, and Tom made a
dash to seize it; but, with the onslaught, the
hand, as if moved by a will of its own, closed
again. Then a convulsive shudder ran through
the man's wasted frame, and a long, long sigh
broke from his heart.</p>

<p>'He dies,' said one of the Ghoorka soldiers,
falling back. 'Give room for his spirit to pass
out of him!'</p>

<p>Space was made round the litter; but Tom
stood there still, with blazing eyes looking down
upon the clenched hand, which might, for all he
knew, hold a message for him.</p>

<p>'A moment, master&mdash;a little moment,'
whispered Hoosanee.</p>

<p>'Try him with your drink!' said Tom.</p>

<p>It was put to his lips; but he could not
swallow. Stooping over him, Hoosanee heard
him murmuring the name of his God. 'It is very
near,' he said.</p>

<p>In the next instant the poor creature started
up. 'Missy Grace!' he cried out. 'Missy
Grace!'</p>

<p>Tom groaned. 'He knows something. Make
him speak. The secret will die with him!' he
sobbed.</p>

<p>'Master,' said Hoosanee solemnly, 'the secret
is at your feet.'</p>

<p>For, with the sudden movement, the clenched
hand had relaxed, the fingers had fallen open,
and the paper they contained had rolled out
upon the ground.</p>

<h5><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII</a></h5>

<h4>THE ADVICE OF BÂL NARÎN</h4>


<p>Tikaram was dead. His was an instance, and
not a solitary one, of the devotion of which the
sons of the soil were capable, both to the children
under their charge, and to the men and women
who in the days of their power had treated them
with consistent kindness. While his co-religionists
covered his face and built hastily a pyre of
dead wood to consume his body, Tom went apart
and, with a beating heart, undid the many foldings
of the paper.</p>

<p>The writing within was in Grace's hand. He
saw this at a glance, but the words were so
faintly traced that he had great difficulty in
deciphering them. He did not, in fact, make it
all out at once. But for us it has been transcribed,
and we are able to give it as it was
written down.</p>

<p>'This is for Tom. I know he is looking for
me. When I have an opportunity I shall throw
it down, addressed to him in his Indian name,
and some one, perhaps hoping for reward, will
take it to him&mdash;&mdash;' A break, and then, 'I cannot
write. I am watched day and night. What
will the end be? I dare not even imagine. But
I must not die while Kit is living.' Another
short break, and then in tremulous, very minute
characters, 'I am afraid of this man. There is
a wicked look in his face. I think he is vindictive;
but what can I have done to offend
him? To-day he threatened to separate me from
Kit. If he does I know what I will do. Don't
fear for me, my beloved ones. My peace-bringer
is still at my heart. When the occasion comes
I know how to use it&mdash;&mdash;' After this last entry
a considerable interval must have elapsed. To
those who read it afterwards it seemed as if some
mental shock had passed over the poor girl,
shattering her nerves. When she wrote again it
was with a sort of surprise. 'I forgot about my
plan&mdash;' so the next entry runs&mdash;'but did I have
a plan? My mind goes from me. Everything
is confused. I feel as if I had been dead, and
had come to life again. Perhaps I have. But
here is my darling Kit sleeping sweetly beside
me in the hut where we have been resting all
day. Is he dead too? Or who is dead? Everything
is confused, and I cannot understand. But
I think he and I are alive. What we are doing
here I don't know in the least. Some one somewhere,
who seemed kind, dressed us in native
dresses and stained our faces, and some one else
gave us a cart and a bullock, and so we go on,
day after day, day after day. Kit says we are
going into Nepaul, for the people there are kind
to the English. The poor English! I wonder
how many of them have been killed! Kit says
we are English, too. I wonder if that is true.
I thought I was English once. I thought I was
a woman and a lady, but that must have been
in another life&mdash;&mdash;' Ah! how strange and pitiful
it was! Spelling it out with pain and difficulty,
Tom felt now and then as if his heart would
break. If he could only weep as Bertie Liston
had done! But he could not. His eyes were
dry and hot, and a fire seemed to be burning
within him, and his breath came and went in
panting sobs like one in the agonies of death.</p>

<p>The last words were more clearly written,
and the collected way in which they were put
together, contrasting vividly with the incoherence
of what went before, gave him a little glimmer
of hope.</p>

<p>'I have slept, and I am better, and I remember
now what I intended to do when I first began
to write this. There is a good man here&mdash;a
hermit or holy man, who has penetrated our
disguise, and who pities us. He has heard from
those who have heard it from others that fugitives
have been inquired for in the villages hereabouts.
He advises us, however, not to linger
here. The Ghoorka army are on their march
southwards, and the people are excited. But he
will try that my scroll may reach those who are
trying to find me. I think Tom is one. If he
finds me&mdash;but I remember that he may see this.
I thank him with all my heart for what he has
done, for what, as I believe, he is still doing for
us. To-morrow we go into the jungle. The
good hermit will guide us. We go towards the
mountains, and we hope to succeed in crossing
them. If this is found let those who find it look
for us in the jungle or on the hills. There may
yet be time to save Kit. He is the noblest and
bravest little fellow that ever lived.'</p>

<p>That was all. The suspicion which had led
Tikaram first, and later the young rajah, to
search for them in the jungle was confirmed, but
there was no further clue. These might be the
last words of the heroic girl before darkness
swallowed her up. And yet it was with a strange
rapture&mdash;a sense of exultation such as he had
not known since he fleshed his maiden sword on
the slaughterers of women and children&mdash;that
Tom pressed the dear missive to his heart. She
was hoping for his help, counting on him as her
defender. And since she had lived through so
much, was it not possible that still, even at this
eleventh hour, he might find her? He dared
not think of it. It was too good, too joyful.
Yet for a few instants the warm blood welled to
his heart, and his pulses beat a triumphant
measure, and it seemed as if all&mdash;all he had
suffered, his toil, his depression, his despair, his
horror, was as nothing. Found! Brought back
in safety; cared for with so deep a tenderness
that the terrors of the way she had gone, and
the misery and humiliation of her capture, would
be forgotten. His heart swelled. The love it
contained made it fit to break. 'It is too much,
too much,' he said to himself. 'I cannot bear it.'</p>

<p>And then he remembered suddenly that his
task was not done, nay, that the hardest part of
it was to come, and he tried to be stern, and to
brace up his energies to do what lay before him.</p>

<p>They had halted in a small open glade. The
pyre on which the body of Tikaram had been
placed was already kindled, and the smoke was
rising into the still air and floating away in
tremulous waves, like heat made visible. The
birds of prey that had been hovering over the litter
were sailing away sullenly, uttering harsh cries.
The men of both cavalcades, taking advantage of
the rest, had tethered their horses and, gathered
together in little groups, were lighting small fires
to cook their evening meal. On all sides they
were hemmed in by the jungle, and, as the shades
of evening gathered, strange noises as of shrieks
and sobbings echoed and re-echoed through the
dense and matted underwood.</p>

<p>Tom had gone apart to read the paper.
When the strong determination to act at once
came upon him, he called up the chief of his little
escort and Hoosanee. The latter, at his request,
fetched two or three of those who had been with
Tikaram. When they were all together Tom
addressed them in Hindoostani. He told them as
much as he could of the paper that had fallen
into his hands, expressed it as his conviction that
those he sought were still wandering in the
jungle, and asked their advice.</p>

<p>Not one of them, not even Hoosanee, but gave
it as his opinion that the fugitives were long
since dead. If they had crossed the Terai, which
was unlikely, they could never have crossed the
mountains. The Ghoorkas were for giving up
the search in despair. Hoosanee said nothing;
his eyes followed those of his master. Tom
asked temperately if, in their opinion, there was
any fear to be entertained of their encountering
detachments of the rebels here. They believed
not. Later there would, no doubt, be many
fugitives from the revolted troops, but there had
not as yet been any English victory of sufficient
importance to cause the rebels to despair. If
they fled from one place they would join their
comrades in another. But jungle-fever was a
worse enemy than revolted sepoys.</p>

<p>Tom said he knew this, and he therefore proposed
that the greater number of those who had
come with him and Tikaram as escorts should
return to their respective regiments. Two or
three of the strongest he would like to retain in
case of accident. But even as regarded this he
would wish them to judge for themselves. The
coolies must go with him to take on the carts
with provision for the way and camp equipage,
and if his Ghoorka friends would do him a kindness
they would take back with them his friend
and servant Hoosanee, recommending him to the
kindness of the Captain Sahib, Gambier Singh,
until such time as he could himself return.</p>

<p>He was interrupted by the sound of sobbing,
and, looking down, saw Hoosanee at his feet.
'Have I offended my master?' said the poor
fellow. 'Have I been indifferent in this search,
or does he reproach me with failing in my service
to him? If I have, let him speak to me!
Nay, let him strike me! I will take punishment
from his hands. But let him not send me away
from him!'</p>

<p>'My good Hoosanee,' said Tom very gently.
'Do you not see that it is of you I am thinking?
You are ill. You cannot deny it.'</p>

<p>'If that is all,' said Hoosanee rising, 'I will
venture to disobey your Excellency's command.'</p>

<p>'How? you will be rebellious!' said Tom
smiling.</p>

<p>'I will do what I know is for the best. Does
my master think that he could go on without me?'</p>

<p>'But consider, Hoosanee&mdash;if you were really
ill&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>'Master, if I die, I die. I will never be
burdensome to you. Let me go on!'</p>

<p>'If you must, there is no more to be said.
But the responsibility is your own,' said Tom
gravely.</p>

<p>The Ghoorkas meanwhile had been discussing
their plans. When, looking radiant, Hoosanee
stood aside, one of them stepped forward, and
spoke. The rajah, he said, had spoken well. If
some of them must die, there was no reason why
all should meet with the same fate, and, in the
province whence they had come, good men were
wanted. They proposed that six of the strongest
from the two escorts should be chosen to attend
the rajah on his farther journey, and that the
rest should return to their captain.</p>

<p>Tom thanked them, and gave orders that all
arrangements should be made for the breaking
up of the party.</p>

<p>When they had withdrawn he held a further
consultation with Hoosanee and the cleverest of
his Ghoorka guides. This man had felt the
curious magnetic power which Tom generally
exercised over Orientals, and had become almost
as much devoted to him as his own servants.
Uninvited, he had joined the conference, and he
now threw himself at his feet and, having begged
that he might be one of those whose services he
would retain, answered, with readiness and perfect
knowledge, his questions about the country.
No one, as it happened, could have been better
acquainted with the low country that lies at the
foot of the hills which separate the Nepaul
valley from the plains of North-West India. The
jungle-fever had no power over him. He breathed
more freely on this pestilential plain than in
the high mountain valleys. Moreover, the wild
tribes, or Aswalias, as they are generally called,
who inhabited the jungle of the Terai, knew and
respected him. Had he not again and again
brought down great Shikaris, or hunters from
the hills, who slew the tigers that devastated
their fields and carried off their little ones? The
great reptiles themselves that, like malignant
spirits, shuddered through the long grass of the
jungle, had no terror for Bâl Narîn, and he carried
with him potions and unguents that could steal
the poison from the deadliest snake-bites.
Though a Ghoorka, therefore, and, as such, a
natural enemy of the wild Aswalias, he had long
been counted their friend. Bâl Narîn shared
his countrymen's admiration for Europeans, of
whom he had been frequently the companion
and guide. It was to fit himself for their service
that he had practised Hindoostani, which he spoke
with quite sufficient ease to carry on a conversation,
and, as this was a rare art amongst the
Ghoorkas, it made him all the more valuable.
His European friends called him Billy&mdash;a trick
into which Tom fell with a readiness that betrayed
him at once to the keen perception of Bâl Narîn,
who had made up his mind long since that he
was far more English than Indian. The discovery,
however, had rather increased than
diminished his reverence for his new lord, to
whom he was now almost as much devoted as
Hoosanee himself.</p>

<p>These three, then, set themselves to discuss
their plans.</p>

<p>Bâl Narîn stated that they were one day's
direct march from the foot of the hills. The
road was not, at that time, nearly so good as it
has since become; but he was able to speak of
it as comparatively safe and easy. With the
ascent of the hills, the difficulties would begin.
Exceedingly precipitous, choked with low underwood
and haunted with wild beasts, the belt of
country which lay between the pestilential swamp
they were now crossing and the middle slopes of
Sisagarhi was almost as dangerous as the Terai,
and far more exhausting to the traveller. The
question was, could a woman and child have
crossed it alone? Bâl Narîn thought not. He
inclined to the opinion that if they were living&mdash;a
point concerning which Tom would admit no
doubt&mdash;they were still on the plain. Hoosanee, on
the other hand, who had witnessed the heroism of
which Grace was capable when she had others
than herself to defend, was loud in his belief that
she had set herself to face the perils of Sisagarhi,
and that she had succeeded in her attempt.</p>

<p>Above the lower belt of which I have spoken,
and on the middle slopes of the first range of
mountains, there are glorious forests and delicious
pastures. In this favoured region, where the
temperature is that of southern Europe at its
best, the oak and the chestnut, the ash and the
elm, the laurel and the magnolia, are to be found
in company with the pipul, the banyan and the
acacia. In the midst of this wealth of vegetation
there are pretty little villages inhabited by
quiet cultivators of the Magar and Newar tribes&mdash;Buddhist
for the most part, and people of gentle
life, over whom the Ghoorka warriors exercise
lordship, in return for a protectorate that is
gratefully welcomed. There are posts here and
there, along the road over the pass, in which
soldiers are stationed, to drive back the savage
and predatory tribes from the south, who, since
the settlement of the country early in the century,
have been able to do little mischief besides
such as might arise from an occasional cattle
raid. It was the fear that these wild tribes, held
in check on one side by the British and on the
other by his own stout little soldiers, might become
powerful and overrun the country that had
induced Jung Bahadoor to originate the policy,
which he carried through with such consistency
and success throughout the year of the rebellion.
Hoosanee, then, gave it as his opinion that the
fugitives had reached this middle region, and
found a temporary resting-place in one of the
villages. He proposed that they should press
forward without an hour's delay, make for the
foot of the hills, and set themselves to climb them.
As for Tom, he wished to go both ways. If
they had reached the further side of the jungle,
he could not bear that they should remain
without help one moment longer than was absolutely
necessary, while, on the other hand, if
they were here on the plain hiding, it might be,
in some miserable hut, how terrible it would be
to leave them to their fate!</p>

<p>'Hoosanee,' he said at last. 'Do you really
wish to please me?'</p>

<p>'Do I wish to please my master?' cried
Hoosanee. 'How can he ask me?'</p>

<p>'I ask you, Hoosanee, because I must put
your affection to the severest test. It has come
to this. We must divide our party. You must
go one way and I another. Listen, and do not
speak until I tell you! I would divide myself if
I could. I would climb Sisagarhi to search for
Miss Grace there, and I would hunt this jungle
through and through, in case she should be hiding
here still. How can I do it? In one way only.
You are my second self, my good friend, and you
must take part of my duty from me.'</p>

<p>'I will stay then. My master shall climb
Sisagarhi.'</p>

<p>'No, Hoosanee. It is you who shall go on.
Be silent! I cannot allow you to decide this.
I have my reasons for what I am doing. Listen
again! You shall take three of the Ghoorkas,
and a runner to send back with intelligence as
soon as you have gained it. I will take the
others, and Billy who knows the people shall go
with me. Come at once! I will divide provisions
and send you on.'</p>

<p>And so it was settled to Hoosanee's distress,
for, although he saw at once that it was necessary
to the success of his enterprise that he and
his master should separate, he would have preferred
to reserve to himself the more dangerous
part. As for Tom, while he felt that the arrangement
he had proposed was the only one which
offered any hope of a good issue to their task,
he was thankful to have succeeded in sending off
Hoosanee to the higher latitudes. In the meantime,
Bâl Narîn was far more useful to himself
than even his own servant could have been.</p>

<h5><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXVIII</a></h5>

<h4>THE SHIKARI'S DISCOVERIES</h4>


<p>Very early the next morning the cavalcade
divided. The released Ghoorka escorts returned
to their regiments. Hoosanee, with good store
of provisions and three mounted soldiers, went
off in the direction of the pass, and Tom,
accompanied by Bâl Narîn, turned off the main
road to seek a byway through the jungle, which
was known to his guide as having been used by
criminals and fugitives, but which was little
frequented by travellers.</p>

<p>It is the fortunes of this last detachment that
I propose to follow, my chief authority being
Bâl Narîn, whom I met a few years ago&mdash;an old
man then, but wonderfully clear as to intellect
and memory&mdash;in his native city, Katmandoo.</p>

<p>That it was a forlorn hope he had felt from
the beginning, and nothing but his extraordinary
regard for the young rajah, who, as he expressed
it, 'held him by his eye,' would have induced
him to go on with it.</p>

<p>I find that he and others looked upon Tom
as perfectly mad at the time. Many Orientals,
however, and Bâl Narîn was fortunately amongst
their number, look upon madness as men of a
later time have looked upon inspiration. The
man himself, they think, is helpless, and the
Divine speaks and acts through him. This, no
doubt, in addition to his peculiar fascinating
power, was the cause of the faithfulness with
which Tom was followed more than once in
his desperate enterprises. Having been prevailed
upon to go forward, Bâl Narîn acted as
Subdul Khan and Hoosanee and Ganesh, and
even Gambier Singh, so far as possible, had
done. He gave himself heart and soul to the
task before him.</p>

<p>He spent the night before they started, not
in resting, but in drawing out a plan of the
Terai, as it was known to him, and making
various imaginary routes to and fro, so that, in
the future, he might be able to say that every
spot within a certain area&mdash;the limits of which
he did not think any fugitives from the Doab
could have crossed&mdash;had been thoroughly
explored. These he proposed to traverse,
penetrating by the way into the solitary haunts
of the half-savage Aswalias, whose language he
knew, and of whose friendship he was sure.
For if such travellers as the English girl and
boy had passed through the more unfrequented
ways, they would most certainly have been
heard of. Even in the jungle and amongst
half-naked savages, extraordinary pieces of news,
as Bâl Narîn knew from experience, are apt to
spread.</p>

<p>The following morning he detailed his plan
to Tom, who listened with hope, and said that
he would be guided by him entirely. That was
a terrible day's march. To cross from the main
road to the bypath that Bâl Narîn knew, it was
necessary to plunge into the jungle, and the
coolies had here and there literally to hack a
way through it for the horses and camels.
Comparatively open spaces, which Tom would
have set himself to canter over gaily, were carefully
avoided by the Ghoorkas, and Bâl Narîn
told him that they were dangerous morasses,
into which he might have disappeared without
hope of rescue. It was still worse when they
reached tracts where the vegetation was larger,
for now giant creepers flung down from the trees
sinuous arms, with thorny leaves that cut into
the flesh of the coolies who hacked them away,
and that, when they touched the flanks of the
horses, made the poor creatures plunge and
snort with pain. The closeness of the atmosphere,
the dank vegetable smells, and the
effluvium from decaying growths, were almost
unendurable. There was danger, too, from the
dwellers in the jungle. A man-eating tiger, had
one been abroad that evening, would have made
short work of these weary men. So, when the
darkness began to gather, they set torches flaring
to frighten all evil things away, and far off in
the cavernous recesses of the jungle-kingdom
they could hear the dull roaring of the disappointed
beasts of prey. That night they rested
as best they could, for Bâl Narîn refused to
accept the responsibility of going on. With
the first break of day, Tom, who was quivering
through every nerve with fierce impatience,
stirred them up. He found the Ghoorka soldiers,
who believed themselves lost beyond hope of
redemption, deeply depressed; but Bâl Narîn
was in excellent spirits. He informed Tom that
he had discovered some of his own traces&mdash;the
marks he had set upon certain trees in one of
his latest hunting-frays; and he knew that his
instinct, by which alone he had been moving on
the previous day, had not deceived him. He
was making straight for the point he wished to
reach. This was encouraging, even to the
soldiers.</p>

<p>They set forward again, and went on for
many hours at a rate of progress terribly slow
to the young rajah's excited nerves. He was on
the strain of expectation. Over and over again
he would pull Bâl Narîn up short and make
him listen to the mysterious whisperings and
flutterings that he had heard himself. But the
experienced guide could explain them all. He
said, moreover, that it was impossible they could
be found here. Not even an Aswalia could
have his dwelling in the midst of such a region.
And Tom tried to control himself. It was
immeasurably hard. All day long&mdash;and never
so much as now&mdash;he was haunted by a sick
dread of that failure at the very moment of
what might, with a little foresight, have been
transcendent success which makes uncertain
enterprises so nerve-harrowing. If she were
near him and he passed her by&mdash;if, from her
hiding-place, she could hear the very tramp of
their horses, and, thinking they were enemies,
plunge more deeply into the jungle!</p>

<p>For so it might be. There was no argument
of Bâl Narîn, to whom he poured out his fears,
which could persuade him that he was cherishing
a phantom fear. Then sometimes, as I have
heard, it would come over him with sharp
throbbing of pain that he was wrong, and that
these were right. It was madness&mdash;nay, it was
the very insanity of folly&mdash;to imagine that,
wandering in this haphazard way without chart
or compass, he would ever succeed in finding
her. She was dead! dead! dead! And if he
were near her, or if he were far away, what
could it matter? The dead hold no commune
with the living. By day and by night the awful
word rang in his ears. Bâl Narîn heard him
repeating it. Dead! Grace was dead&mdash;all her
loveliness and sweetness&mdash;all her heroism and
patience&mdash;with the love and passion and tenderness
unutterable that she had inspired in the
hearts of others&mdash;gone!&mdash;lost to the earth for
ever and ever and ever! There were moments
in those awful days when his soul went out
beyond the limits of its own despair, and when
abysses of sorrow&mdash;fathomless as the graves in
which our beloved be buried&mdash;would seem to
open out before his feet. Mad! Was he mad?
No, he would say to himself: it was the world&mdash;dull
of eye and ear&mdash;insensible&mdash;suffering itself
to be shrouded with the veil of spiritual blindness
which nature throws round her human
children, as she woos them softly to fulfil her
behests&mdash;the world was mad&mdash;he was sane. To
him, in his anguish, the anguish of the universe
had been revealed&mdash;a pandemonium of woe that
made him sicken and tremble and cry out for
Death, even the Death of eternity, to release
him from the torturing memory.</p>

<p>But, miserable as his thoughts were, they did
not delay his steps. Guided by Bâl Narîn he
plodded on quietly hour after hour.</p>

<p>On the evening of the second day, they
emerged from the jungle, and, to the great contentment
of the whole party, came to opener
ground. On the banks of a sluggish stream,
whose course they had been following for some
time, the weeds and shrub had been cleared
away to give place to scanty herbage and lush
green paddy-fields. An Aswalia village&mdash;a
melancholy little group of tiny bark huts&mdash;had
been planted in the clearing. It was a landmark
for which Bâl Narîn had been looking. As soon
as he caught sight of it, he made his party halt,
and cantered on to make inquiries, and to prepare
the villagers, who were exceedingly jealous
of their rights, for the passage of strangers.</p>

<p>He was away long enough to make Tom impatient;
but when he returned, his radiant face
showed that he brought good news with him.</p>

<p>'Are they in the village?' cried Tom, leaping
at once to the conclusion which, a moment before,
had seemed too rapturous, even for a vision.</p>

<p>'No,' said Bâl Narîn, drawing rein. 'But
they have been heard of.'</p>

<p>'Where? where? Let us set off at once!
You are our saviour, our good genius,' cried Tom.</p>

<p>'The Sahib must be pleased to have patience
still,' said Bâl Narîn, with dignity. 'I will tell
him what I have heard, and then he shall decide
what we are to do. Two days ago&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Two days&mdash;only two days&mdash;you are sure&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I am telling my tale to the Sahib as it was
told to me. Two days ago a woman and a little
girl, who said that they were servants of the
English, came into the village. A holy man was
with them. He was from the Doab, he said. He
had met the woman flying from murderers, and
he had vowed to carry her safely across the
mountains with her child. They were afraid to
go by the main road, and they were seeking the
pass known as the "robbers' road." The headman
is quiet and good when he sees no chance of
plunder. I know him well. There was nothing
about the travellers to tempt him, and perhaps
he would have been afraid to hurt the holy man.
They were given shelter and provisions, for which
the woman and child gave the bangles of silver
that they still wore. The headman pitied them,
and he would not take all. He directed them to
the next village, let them rest for a night, and
sent them on. I asked how they were travelling,
and he said they had a bullock-cart.'</p>

<p>'But how do you know&mdash;&mdash;' began Tom.</p>

<p>'Patience, Sahib! I am coming to that. The
child, they tell me, wore a little embroidered cap
under her muslin veil. The cap was of a pretty
red colour, and one of the women in the village
took a fancy to it. She came behind the child
and lifted it off. Then, Sahib, all who stood
round were speechless with surprise, for the child
gave a cry, and the woman caught it to her
arms, and long yellow curls fell down about its
shoulders. What does the Sahib say to that?'</p>

<p>'It was Kit,' said Tom. 'But go on, for
heaven's sake. Did the villagers show them any
unkindness?'</p>

<p>'No, Sahib, none. I think, from what I
hear, that they were more friendly than before.
Perhaps they thought they would gain a reward
by-and-by. The headman begged them to remain,
offering to keep them till the war was over.
But the woman would not hear of it. She said,
for the child's sake, she must go on to the mountains.
But, Sahib, they could not travel fast,
and I know the way they have gone&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You think it a miracle that they should
have lived so long, Bâl Narîn?'</p>

<p>'Sahib, it is the strangest thing I have
ever heard. The gods have cared for their
own.'</p>

<p>'And since they have got so far, am I mad
in thinking they may go farther?'</p>

<p>'Who said that his Excellency was mad?'</p>

<p>'No one said so. I have read it in your
eyes, Billy. But we are both sane now. Yes&mdash;it
is no question of madness. Two days. What
could they have done in that time? They could
not travel day and night as we will.'</p>

<p>'If we travel at night we may miss them,
Sahib.'</p>

<p>'True; I had not thought of that. But,
come on now. There are two good hours of
light before us. Then you shall rest, and I will
watch. Have you been able to get any fresh
provisions?'</p>

<p>'They are bringing in bags of dal and rice,
which will last us for six more days. By that
time we shall have reached the further boundaries
of the Terai.'</p>

<p>And so they went on once more.</p>

<p>I try to imagine it all sometimes, but I confess
I find it hard, although Bâl Narîn and the
rajah himself, in the moments of confidence
that come to him on rare occasions, have again
and again given me narratives of their experiences.</p>

<p>They went on for two more days. This part
of the jungle was haunted by tigers. At night,
when they made up their camp-fires, they could
hear them howling about the sluggish streams
that crept through the jungle. There were serpents,
too. Tom slew one monster that reared
itself up in his path by striking its head with the
butt-end of his musket. But to him the most
appalling feature of all this march was the
swooping down of the foul birds of prey that
came from their eyrie in the hills in search of
such meat as the jungle would always yield.
The creatures had not the least fear; they came
so near, sometimes, that he could have struck
at them with his cane. It seemed as if they
were waiting for the death that might presently
fall upon their victims.</p>

<p>He shot down two of these mighty birds in
one day, glorying over them as he had gloried
over the sepoys whom he had destroyed.</p>

<p>His mind, in the meantime, was oscillating
between hope and despair. Every hour increased
his impatience, and added to his horror and
uncertainty. It was true that, only a few days
before, they had been seen living, and still, so
far as he could gather, in good health; but
would not the difficulties and dangers of this
further journey, which taxed their own resources
to the utmost, break these tender wanderers
down? And to fail at the last moment,
when help was actually within reach&mdash;how infinitely
pitiful it would be! He had one comfort,
meanwhile&mdash;Bâl Narîn was with him. The news
heard at the Aswalia village had completely won
over the wily Ghoorka guide. Hitherto he had
gone on with the enterprise to indulge his employer,
and humour the mad caprice of an Englishman
who had cast his spell over him. While
the European rajah 'held him with his eye,' he
could not refuse to follow him. Now, first, he
began to believe in a happy issue. He would
not say much about it, for he was fearful, if he
gave an encouragement which turned out to be
unfounded, the young rajah would sicken and
die of despair; but Tom, who could read the
minds of his people, knew that he was going
forward with renewed energy.</p>

<p>It was on the second day after they left the
village behind them that Bâl Narîn's experienced
eye began to detect marks which led him to
believe that they were actually, at last, on the
fugitives' track.</p>

<p>They were in the path known in this region
as the robbers' road&mdash;a path which, though distinct
enough to the experienced, was difficult to
pass over, being much choked with vegetation.
Kutcha-grass, growing to an immense height,
made dense walls on either side of the road.
They were in their usual marching order&mdash;the
coolies in front beating down obstructions, Tom
riding behind them, and peering anxiously into
the recesses of the jungle, behind him the
Ghoorka soldiers mounted on camels, and Bâl
Narîn bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>The guide was on foot, and studying the
ground. He saw something shining, and, stooping
to pick it up, found that it was a silver bead
such as the women of these parts often wear in
their bangles. He has told me that the excitement
caused by this apparently simple discovery
was so great that he could scarcely refrain from
shouting it aloud. But, in the next moment, he
realised that it might not mean anything&mdash;that,
in any case, it would be unwise to place too
much reliance upon it. This was the robbers'
road, and it was more than possible that the bit
of silver might have dropped from one of their
bags of spoil. He went on examining the
ground, and carefully scrutinising the walls of
kutcha-grass. Presently he made another discovery;
but it was so small a thing that no eyes
save those of an experienced hunter of beasts
and men, like Bâl Narîn, could have discerned
it. Low down, where a weed, whose fleshy
leaves are armed with spiked thorns, grew
among the grass, he thought he saw a single
white thread. Eagerly he swooped upon it, and
picked it up, and now he could scarcely restrain
his excitement, for the thread told the same tale
as the bead. A muslin saree, such as those
worn by women of the plains, had certainly
swept those thorny weeds. It was probable
that the bead had been dropped by the woman
who wore the muslin veil. Taking them together,
there could be little doubt that women
dressed in the Indian fashion had passed this
way. But, if so, there would be other signs
that he could read&mdash;signs that might, perhaps,
lead him straight to their hiding-place.</p>

<p>So, with bent head and beating heart, he
proceeded on his search.</p>

<p>About a hundred yards further on he picked
up another bead, which matched the first. He
judged from its position&mdash;it was poised, as it
were, on a little blade of grass, and the least
agitation of the air would have dislodged it&mdash;that
it had been only recently dropped.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, these narrow investigations had
seriously delayed his progress. When he made
this last discovery, he looked up and found
himself alone. Those he was leading had gone
on in front of him. The sound of the whistle,
with which the rajah was accustomed to keep
his little party together, came ringing down the
lane at this moment. Bâl Narîn answered it
with a peculiar call of his own, and a few instants
later he heard the hoofs of his chief's
horse, as Tom cantered back to find him.</p>

<p>'Rajah Sahib!' he cried out, waving him
back. 'I cannot come on yet. You must have
patience with me, and I may bring you news.'</p>

<p>'News here! You are dreaming, Billy,'
answered Tom very sadly. 'Who could bring
us news in this wilderness?'</p>

<p>'That is my concern, master. Leave me, I
entreat of you, and, as you cannot go forward
alone, let the men rest and eat! I will join you
by-and-by.'</p>

<p>Mournfully the rajah turned his horse's
head. This, of course, was one of Bâl Narîn's
whims; but it would have to be indulged, for
he was completely in his hands.</p>

<p>It was now late in the afternoon, and the
men, who had been riding hard all day, were
glad of rest and food. Languidly, for the air of
these pestilential regions has a numbing effect
upon the energies of men, the soldiers unsaddled
and lighted a fire, round which they crouched,
while one of their number cooked the dal and
chupatties that served them for their meal. Tom
dismounted, tethered his horse to a stake which
his men had driven into the ground, and, feeling
it unwise to join Bâl Narîn, who never liked to
be disturbed when he was working out a fresh
idea, strolled about aimlessly. The camels and
bullock-carts, carrying their larger supplies,
were coming up behind them, so he could not
take his own meal; but, in fact, he did not want
to eat. The excitement that had been working
within him since Bâl Narîn sent him away made
him feel that food would choke him.</p>

<p>His restlessness, meanwhile, was terrible. He
was possessed with those miserable, impossible
longings which come to most of us at the great
crises of our lives&mdash;when our senses and the
faculties bestowed upon us by Heaven seem too
little for our need; when we crave madly for
some indefinite power&mdash;some loosening of the
bonds of our humanity&mdash;some super-sensuous
divine knowledge and strength to carry us, at
one leap, to the bourne where our restless
hearts would be. Secrets, deep as the grave,
and high as the infinite azure, are weighing
down upon our little lives. In the level light
of every-day life we forget them. They circle
about us, and we see them not. It is when the
light departs&mdash;when the little life with its little
interests becomes tragic, that they come&mdash;this
grey host of shadows&mdash;and mock us with our
impotence. Sometimes we strike out blindly,
as children strike at tables. We must know;
we will know. It cannot be that we have
reached thus far, and that never, through all
the infinite ages that must be, we can reach any
farther. That would be hideous&mdash;revolting to
our moral sense. 'Give us light, give us light!'
we cry out to the Power which, as God, or
Nature, or blind Force, holds our destinies in
its hand. 'Give us light, or kill us!' And
only the awful silence answers us, 'Neither
light nor death, poor soul; only a blind going
forward to an unknown goal!'</p>

<p>Such was Tom's condition that evening. As
he looked round on this desolate land, given up
to monstrous growths and fierce animals, with
his hopes dwindling every moment, he felt a
terror of his own littleness that almost maddened
him. Devoured by impatience, he could do
nothing. If he moved a few yards from his
party he would be lost, and without Bâl Narîn
he would be more helpless and hopeless than
ever. The necessities of his humanity; the grossness
and opacity of his senses; his weakness
and his ignorance, were such that, if the dear
prize for which he would willingly have laid
down his life were in his grasp, he might not
be able to seize it. Many men in his position
would have cried out to their God. He could
not. What he did actually believe was not very
clear, even to himself, at that time. The strange
mysticism, so fascinating to a high intelligence,
that animates some of the older Oriental philosophies
had become curiously blended in his mind
with the cut-and-dried orthodoxy in which he
had been brought up. But he knew what he
did not believe, and special providences, miracles
worked benevolently for favoured mortals, were
amongst the things that he had renounced long
ago.</p>

<p>So, with neither hope nor help, only a vague
determination to go on until he died, he went to
and fro, like a restless wild creature. When he
was out of his men's sight he would clench his
fists and strike out at an imaginary foe, and
mutter fiercely; when he returned to them he
would be as they had always seen him&mdash;quiet
and stern.</p>

<p>An hour passed by. A sickly evening dimness
was creeping over the desolate land; he
fancied he could hear the animal-world of the
jungle rising up to meet the night, and his impatience
grew to such a pitch that he could
scarcely restrain himself. Presently the camels
and bullock-carts came up. He asked the
coolies if they had met Bâl Narîn. They shook
their heads. He had not certainly been seen on
the road. This made the young rajah exceedingly
uneasy; but the Ghoorkas, whom he consulted,
did not share in his fear. Bâl Narîn,
they said, knew what he was about. Most
likely he did not care to go any farther that
night, and he had laid down where he was, so as
not to be ordered on. If he did not join them
in the evening, they would certainly see him at
daybreak. With this Tom tried to be satisfied,
for it was quite evident that he could do nothing.
The men would not stir without Bâl Narîn, and
for him to do so alone would be as useless as it
was dangerous.</p>

<p>They made him up his usual evening meal,
a mess of rice and fried vegetables; but he
could not eat a morsel. Mounting his horse, he
rode slowly back to the point where he had seen
Bâl Narîn last. Here he whistled, cried out,
tried to ride through the kutcha-grass; but was
driven back by the venomous tribes of insects
that had come out with the dying down of the
day; then realising that these spasmodic efforts
were perfectly useless, he returned to the road,
and paced back sadly and slowly, seeing no signs
of Bâl Narîn anywhere.</p>

<p>The camp was illuminated by gleaming
brands set high on poles, and the little cooking-fires
were smouldering in its midst. It made a
spot of glowing red in the spectral darkness;
where everything but it was being slowly obliterated.
Tom would have preferred the darkness;
but he knew very well that in the jungle he was
surrounded with nameless dangers. If he did
not wish to give his body for a meal to the
beasts of prey that were ranging it, he must
keep in the neighbourhood of his companions.
So, trying to still his fiery impatience, he lay
down where they had spread his canvas sheets,
drew a gauze net over his face, and lighted a
pastile to keep the cloud of insects at a distance.</p>

<p>I have spoken of Tom's gift of sleeping at
will. Even in this terrible emergency it did not
desert him. He had learned a few lessons,
however, in his life of adventure, and it would
not have been so easy now as on his first expedition
to steal a march upon him.</p>

<p>The sleep, light and brief as it was, refreshed
and invigorated him. When, having indulged
in it for about two hours, he sprang up and
looked round, he found that the feverish madness
of excitement which, if given place to,
would have unfitted him for work that needed
decision and readiness, had gone. His brain
was clear, and his limbs had lost their languor.</p>

<p>In the encampment everything was as it had
been. The fires were smouldering and the
torches flamed. Two Ghoorkas were on guard.
The rest slept, while the camel-drivers, syces,
and coolies sat doubled up together, their knees
touching their noses, near the beasts of burden
which were tethered in the centre of the encampment.</p>

<p>It was dead night; but the darkness was not
such as it had been earlier, for a three-quarter
moon had come up from her bed of snows
behind awful Himâla and was shedding over the
desolate land a pale light, which, defective as it
was, Tom hailed with pleasure.</p>

<p>'You have often been my friend, Lady
Moon,' he said, as he gazed up into the vapour-veiled
sky, 'and though you don't shine as you
do in the plains, I think you will give me light
enough to see what I am doing.'</p>

<p>One of the Ghoorka sentinels, in the meantime,
seeing him on his feet, had approached
him. 'Does the Rajah Sahib require anything?'
he asked.</p>

<p>'I want to know if Bâl Narîn has been seen,'
said Tom.</p>

<p>'Bâl Narîn has not come back to camp,'
answered the man.</p>

<p>'Then, of course, he has not been seen,' said
Tom impatiently. 'Have you heard anything?'</p>

<p>'We have heard nothing but the beasts of
the jungle. Purtab killed a serpent. It would
have stung him. The gods grant that it may
not bring misfortune!'</p>

<p>'The gods have brought Purtab good fortune,
my friend. His life is better than a snake's&mdash;to
himself at least.'</p>

<p>'That is as it may be, Sahib,' said the man
enigmatically.</p>

<p>'Settle it your own way, but, in the meantime,
listen to me! I don't like this lengthened
absence of Bâl Narîn's, and I fear some evil has
come to him. I will go and look round.'</p>

<p>'If you go far, Sahib, you will never return.
This is the devil's hunting-ground. Men in company
they spare. Solitary men they destroy.'</p>

<p>'Then how about Bâl Narîn?'</p>

<p>'Even the devil will not slay his own offspring,'
said the man with a chuckle. 'Bâl Narîn
is safe, wherever he goes.'</p>

<p>'Is he?' said Tom laughing. 'I wish I had
such distinguished ancestry; however, I am not
afraid. I have my revolver and my sword. If
I whistle, try and find me.'</p>

<p>'Right, Sahib!' said the man, falling back.</p>

<h4>WHAT BÂL NARÎN HAD BEEN DOING</h4>


<p>We return to Bâl Narîn, whom we left pondering
deeply on the significance that might belong
to a muslin thread and two little silver beads.</p>

<p>To make this part of my narrative clear, I
must explain, having received the information
from this cleverest of Ghoorka guides, that besides
the robbers' path, as it was called, there were
other narrow tracks running in every direction
through the jungle. These were due to the
animals that at this season make the kutcha-grass
their haunt. Wild beasts, like civilised men, are
the creatures of habit. They love their old lairs
and their daily walks, and are given to ranging
certain circumscribed areas, which, no doubt,
are to them what our village, city, or club is to
us. These animal highways, then, had, through
repeated use, become widened and trodden down,
so that it would have been easy for the inexperienced
to mistake them for paths frequented
by men. When Bâl Narîn so impetuously waved
Tom away, the notion that thus it might have
happened to the fugitives of whom he was in
search had suddenly come to him. It was a
terrible thought, for in such case they would
probably have walked right into a wild beast's
lair, and nothing could save them from destruction.
The idea, however, having occurred to
Bâl Narîn, he could not cast it off.</p>

<p>His mind was of that dogged type which
often distinguishes men of his profession. From
his boyhood it had been his meat and drink to
struggle with difficulties and overcome them.
The more arduous the task the better it pleased
him, and the mere fact of his having entertained
the possibility of undertaking it was stimulus
sufficient to make him carry it through. By sympathy
in the first place and severe personal effort
crowned by partial success in the second, he
had worked himself up to strong interest in this
work of rescue, and passionate determination
that nothing should be wanting on his part to
bring it to a successful issue. All the force, all
the dogged resolution of his nature was aroused.
Working for the master whose kindliness and
grace had won his attachment, he was also working
for himself, that no man in the future might
relate how Bâl Narîn had failed in the task he
took in hand.</p>

<p>It was in this mood that the new idea met
him, and he set himself immediately to work it
out. On the robbers' road, where he had been
told he might find the fugitives, he had seen
indications which led him to believe that he was
on their track. If these indications continued
he would know, as far as it was possible to know
anything, that the fugitives were on ahead of
him. If, on the other hand, they stopped at any
particular point, there would be every reason to
suppose that the road had been abandoned, in
which case he saw that there would be nothing
for him to do but to try the likeliest of the jungle
paths.</p>

<p>Quietly he stole on. A few yards ahead of
the spot where he had paused to take his bearings
the road was crossed by a path wider than
itself, and of such character and appearance as
to be almost certain to mislead any but the
dwellers in the jungle, or those who, like Bâl
Narîn, had traversed it so often as to be fully
acquainted with all its peculiarities.</p>

<p>He happened to know it, for it led to a little
marsh surrounded lake where the tigers went
down at night to quench their thirst, and near
which he had waited for them more than once
with European sportsmen.</p>

<p>He had lighted his lamp meanwhile, for he
always carried one in his belt, and with its help
he was examining the ground. Close to the
opening of this jungle-road, where it turned off
the road to the right, he found a third bead. He
went on for some distance and saw nothing, then
he retraced his steps. A conviction amounting
almost to certainty had come to him that it was
down this pathway those poor souls had gone.
If so he must follow them. Having looked well
to the priming of his revolver, and taken from
its sheath the short, murderous-looking knife,
which he had used several times with effect in
close encounters with his fierce jungle-foes, Bâl
Narîn adventured himself into the wild beasts'
highway.</p>

<p>At first he found nothing to confirm his conjecture.
The character of his surroundings
had changed. Instead of the tall kutcha-grass
there were about him low, thorny bushes, with
here and there a ghostly-looking tree; and
nullahs, in which hideous forms of vegetable
life were growing, stretched along the sides
of the beast-trodden path. A strange way
it was, and devious, going straight for a few
yards, and then shooting from right to left, as,
like the fire-flash from lightning-charged clouds,
it followed the track of least resistance. A
dangerous region, and Bâl Narîn, being too old
a hunter to be caught napping, trod warily.
Once, however, he almost lost his caution. It
was when the light of his lamp fell on a shred of
coloured stuff that clung to one of the spiked
leaves of a sickly, stunted aloe. That moment,
he has told me, was one of the strangest, the
most triumphant of his whole fife. He knew
now that the sagacity upon which he prided
himself had not failed him in his need. Whether
the fugitives were found or not, he had positive
proof that they had passed this way.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the darkness that had made Tom
curse his helplessness began to assail Bâl Narîn's
more subtly tempered senses. He did not mind
it. All his greatest enterprises had been carried
out in the night time, for it was then that the
foes with whom he waged war were at large, and
the blackness of the heavens rather quickened
than deadened his energies. He drew aside quietly
from the beasts' highway, let his lamp, which
was burning steadily, shine in front of him, and
having twisted some of the gigantic stems of the
kutcha-grass into a torch as he came along, he
set light to it, and held it flaming over his
shoulder. Thus equipped he was far too terrible
an object for even the man-eating tiger to
tackle. So he went on towards the marsh-surrounded
lake.</p>

<p>But what was his distinct object? He could
not, I think, have explained it to himself. I
found, in fact, when I tried to pin him to this
point of his narrative, that a peculiar confusion
reigned in his mind. Up to it and beyond it he
was perfectly clear. He could tell about everything,
even the working of his own mind. Here
he faltered and stumbled in his speech. 'Why
did I go on?' he exclaimed to me one day.
'Sahib, I must confess to you that I cannot tell.
I should have been mad to think that they were
alive. I should have been mad to suppose that,
if they were alive, I should find them in that
darkness. I knew I was going into danger.
Think, Sahib, of where I should have been if my
lamp had gone out. I thought of that myself.
"Billy," I said, "you are a fool. You are
running into danger like an ass that has no wit
to keep out of it. Go back! Tell them at the
camp what you have found, and bring the rajah
and his men with you to search this place in the
daylight." That would have been the wisest
plan, Sahib. Why did I not take it? As I live
I cannot tell you. Sometimes,' his voice dropped
mysteriously, 'I have thought that it was not of
my own will I went forward. The Sahib, being
a wise man, will understand. There are things
of which it is not well to speak too plainly. The
jealousy of the gods is easy to rouse, and difficult
to stay.'</p>

<p>I knew what Bâl Narîn meant, and I nodded
my approval, whereupon he proceeded with his
story. Though, as he had confessed, he was
going forward without any distinct aim, his
vigilance did not sleep for a moment. His ear,
trained to a subtlety of perception such as we,
dwellers in towns, and inheritors of the grossness
born of luxurious living, can scarcely
imagine, was alive to every sound. His eyes
searched the darkness. His sense of touch,
which was not, as with us, confined to the effects
that arise from actual contact, sent out feelers in
every direction. Through his delicate nostrils&mdash;the
subtlest of the nine gates of the body&mdash;he
interrogated the humid atmosphere, finding
separate odours where we should have distinguished
nothing but the vaporous distilments
of the jungle.</p>

<p>Presently he came to a full stop, lowered
his torch, and drew a long breath. Something
strange, subtle, impalpable, was floating towards
him. He could not for a moment determine
what it was or even through which of the sense-avenues
it had come; but he knew, he was penetrated
with a conviction as strong as death, that
presences, either spiritual or corporeal, but other
than the beasts of the jungle, were near him.</p>

<p>He paused for fully five seconds, making an
effort to define his sensations, and in the meantime
he made another observation.</p>

<p>Overhead the darkness grew darker, there
was a curious agitation of the air, and he knew
that the vast birds of the mountains&mdash;the eagle
and the vulture&mdash;were flying round him in ever-narrowing
circles. The dead or the dying, then,
were near, and they had scented them from
their eyrie in the hills. At this moment, when he
had recognised the birds as blots on the blackness,
and was straining his eyes to follow their flight,
there was a faint glimmer of light in the east from
the rising moon. Faint as it was it gave the
shikari all the light he needed to enable him to
see plainly. He looked up and saw a gigantic
bird sailing slowly down the wind. His heart
beat, and his blood seemed to bound in his veins
as he watched it, for it was taking the direction
whence his own sense-perception had come. A
second followed, and then a third. By the help
of the silver light in the east he was able to keep
them in sight. Leaping nullahs, tearing through
thick jungle, uttering fierce cries to frighten
away the wild creatures that might be crouching
in cover, he followed in their track. If he had
stopped to think, as he has told me, he could
not have done it. Nor would it ever have
occurred to him to follow the birds, had it not
been for that impression, inexplicable even to
this day to himself, that unseen presences were
near him. But once started he staggered on.
Insects stung him, thorns cut into his flesh, his
torch was extinguished, his lamp burned dim.
Through all his excitement he realised that if he
was left in darkness he was lost beyond hope of
redemption. His life-foes would have him as
their prey. No one would ever hear of Bâl Narîn
again. Once he fell, but he sprang to his feet
again and flourished his lamp, and a tiger, disturbed
in his lair, rushed by with angry growling
that would have chilled the blood of a man of
ordinary courage.</p>

<p>But still he held on. The vulture sailed on,
swooped down, rose into the air with a harsh
cry&mdash;was it of disappointment?&mdash;swooped
down again, and was lost in the jungle. But
Bâl Narîn was triumphant, for he had marked
the very spot of his disappearance. The
second bird and the third sailed up. They
helped him to mark the spot. He could not
mistake it now, for a tall cotton-tree, whose
candelabra-like branches stood out boldly from
the silver grey of the eastern sky, was in its
immediate neighbourhood. There were few of
these trees in the Terai, and they indicated places
where the soil was comparatively wholesome.
So far as he could judge he was not now very
far from the tree which made his landing mark,
but there was still a wide nullah to be crossed.
Torn and exhausted as he was he experienced
some difficulty in getting to the other side, and
he considered himself happy in meeting no tiger.
He had scarcely force left to grapple with one.</p>

<p>And now, to his measureless surprise, he saw
the jungle open out before him. A small clearing,
such as those in which the Aswalia villages
are planted, only of much more limited extent,
lay under his eyes. A low fig-tree, a stunted
bamboo, and the cotton-tree which he had
already seen, could be dimly discerned through
the darkness. Nothing else at first except the
three vast birds. They sat side by side under
the cotton-tree, as if in hideous expectation of a
feast. Bâl Narîn stamped his foot and cried out,
and they rose slowly, but they did not go far.
They hovered overhead, and it seemed to him
that they were watching his movements.</p>

<p>And now, pausing, he could hear distinctly
sounds as of fluttered stirring to and fro, and
breath drawn labouringly. He trimmed his
lamp and went on cautiously, carrying it before
him. In a few instants its light fell on a rude
shed, made of branches of trees and dried leaves.
On the side by which he had approached it there
was no opening; but he could see, through the
interstices between the branches, that figures
were moving about within. Giving it rather a
wide berth so as to see before he was seen, he
came round to the front, and pulled up for a few
moments to observe what was going on.</p>

<p>Within the small enclosure, which was such
a hut as hermits dwell in, he saw three figures.
Two were on the ground, whether dead or asleep
he could not tell, and the third&mdash;a slender figure
in woman's garments&mdash;was going from one to the
other, stooping over them, and, as it seemed to
Bâl Narîn, weeping bitterly. While he was considering
how he should reveal himself without
increasing her distress and alarm, she came out
to the front of the hut, and, his lamp being
turned that way, he saw her plainly. That was
a moment which Bâl Narîn will never forget.
For an instant he shut his eyes. He was seized
with a tremor that seemed to be drawing away
his power, and the presence of mind on which
he prided himself. Wild as she was, with that
haunting terror in her sweet eyes that was never,
so long as she lived, to leave them again, there
was a beauty and majesty in this face that awed
him, he could not have told why. It was like
the face of a spirit, he said&mdash;of one who had
done with the earth for ever. Thus for a
moment he saw it; in the next it was suffused
with a horror and anguish, such as he had never
beheld before. Looking up, he saw the heavens
darkened with the wings of the birds of prey
that were swooping nearer and nearer to the
entrance of the hut, as if they would defy this
weak living woman to keep them any longer
from the dead.</p>

<p>A cry of unspeakable despair broke from the
woman's lips, and she agitated her arms wildly
above her head. They retired, settled, approached
again, the girl still gesticulating wildly.
Then the ping of the shikari's revolver rang
through the jungle. Again it sounded, and
again, the girl retreated trembling, and two of
the birds fell to the ground mortally wounded,
while their mate sailed away sullenly to his
eyrie in the hills.</p>

<p>Before the echo of his last shot had died
away, Bâl Narîn was standing with bowed head
before the girl in the hut, and addressing her in
his choicest Hindoostani. 'Let me entreat my
gracious lady not to fear me,' he said. 'I am a
poor hunter from the hills&mdash;a man of the
Ghoorka nation, to whom the white races are
honourable. I saw my gracious lady's distress,
and I slew the birds that caused her fear. Can
I help her further?'</p>

<p>'Could you help me&mdash;would you?' said the
poor girl.</p>

<p>'Let my gracious lady try me?' said Bâl
Narîn.</p>

<p>At this moment there rang another sound
through the jungle&mdash;a low whistle, prolonged
and flute-like, but curiously tremulous, that
seemed to be floating down from above them.
The girl pressed her finger to her lips, and a
colour, soft as the crimson of the morning,
flooded her pale face.</p>

<p>The tremulous, sweet sounds go on&mdash;they
form themselves into a melody. Ah! What is
this? What is this? In a moment&mdash;in less than
a moment&mdash;the poor girl is back again in the
past. Under her feet is a carpet of soft, green
grass; above, swayed gently to and fro by the
breath of a June morning in England, wave the
light branches of a weeping willow-tree&mdash;the
waters of a river lie before her&mdash;a boat is cutting
through them&mdash;it has one rower. Oh! the fair,
boyish face&mdash;the dreamy eyes&mdash;the rapture of
adoring love!</p>

<p>'Come where my love lies dreaming,' he
sings.</p>

<p>'Yes; I am dreaming. I must awake,' sobs
poor Grace.</p>

<p>The sounds go on&mdash;distant but clear.
'Dreaming the happy hours away&mdash;Come&mdash;Come&mdash;Come
where my love&mdash;&mdash;' Groaning,
she covers her face with her hands.</p>

<p>Bâl Narîn, in the meantime, is showing the
most extraordinary excitement&mdash;shouting, dancing,
tossing his hands about in exultation.
Returning from her dream, the girl gazes at him
in speechless surprise.</p>

<p>'Pardon your servant, gracious lady,' he
says, 'if his pleasure lifts him off his feet! My
master and I have waited for this moment. As
the sick unto death long for the morning, so
have we longed for it, and how can I help being
triumphant?'</p>

<p>'Your&mdash;master?' says the girl, fixing her
large, fever-bright eyes upon his face.</p>

<p>'My master&mdash;the Rajah of Gumilcund. He
is on his way. He will be here soon, if&mdash;now
the demons of the jungle guide him! Here!
here!' he cries, lapsing into his native Ghoorka
in his overpowering excitement. 'Look for the
cotton-tree! Ah! what a fool I am! He does
not know my tongue. Lady, you have a light
within?'</p>

<p>Trembling with excitement, Grace ran inside
and caught up a little rush-candle&mdash;their last!</p>

<p>'One moment, dearest Kit!' she cried, for a
little moan had come up from the ground.
'They have found us. Tom&mdash;our Tom&mdash;will
soon be here. He will frighten the dreadful
birds away.'</p>

<p>She ran out to Bâl Narîn, who had torn off
a dried stick from the cotton-tree and twisted a
bunch of withered grass to its extremity.
Anointed with the drop of oil left in his lamp
and lighted from the rush-candle, it flamed out
brilliantly in a moment. He waved it over his
head and rushed forward with shouts into the
jungle, 'This way, master; this way!'</p>

<p>But in a few instants he returned to the
space before the hut, fed his torch with wisps of
straw, and caught up the rush-candle. The
whistling had ceased, and there was no answer
to his frenzied cries. Grace looked up into his
face and saw its hazard look.</p>

<p>'Is he not there?' she moaned.</p>

<p>'It is a dangerous road,' he answered, 'and
my master is not a shikari like Bâl Narîn. Listen,
Miss Sahib! Do you hear that?'</p>

<p>'Thunder. I have heard it several times
to-night.'</p>

<p>'Not thunder&mdash;the tramp of a herd of wild
elephants. Miss Sahib, I must go&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>But Grace did not hear. She had rushed
back into the hut. With hands cramped
together and beating heart she was crouched on
the ground, near the couch of dried grass where
she had laid her little Kit, praying that the
Father in heaven, in Whom through all these
dreadful days she had trusted, would, at this last
moment, be gracious to them.</p>

<p>'Save him, oh! Father,' she sobbed. 'Let
him take my darling Kit from this awful place,
and then my work will be done, and I will go to
Thee.'</p>

<p>Over and over again, while Kit's little arms
were about her neck and his burning cheek
rested on her shoulder, she whispered the same
words, 'Save him! Save him!'</p>

<p>Moments passed into minutes. The hold of
Kit's arms relaxed, as, lulled by the sound of her
voice, he fell back upon the pillow. Her own
head drooped. The long and awful watch by
the dead that lay in the hut with them&mdash;the
sudden shock of terror and joy&mdash;the suspense&mdash;the
strain of expectation seemed to be more than
her enfeebled frame could bear. Her mind
wandered. 'Kit! keep me awake,' she whispered.
'Those awful birds will come again.' But Kit
did not hear her. He was dropping off into a
doze. Her eyelids fell. Oh! if she could only
sleep! If somebody was here&mdash;a friend&mdash;some
one who would watch for her, and keep the
birds and beasts away! Ah!&mdash;she started up
suddenly, wide awake and trembling in every
limb. The light that was diffused through the
tent&mdash;that shone on the rigid form of the old
man who had protected them so far, giving at
the last his life for theirs, and on the yellow
matted curls of poor little Kit&mdash;was the light of
the moon. There was nothing to keep the wild
things out. A convulsive shudder agitated her
frame, and she tried to rise but could not. Then
she put her face down near Kit's. 'My poor
darling,' she whispered. 'It is all over. I had
a dream. It has gone&mdash;and I have no more
strength to fight.'</p>

<h4>THE ELEPHANTS' CHACE</h4>


<p>This, in the meantime, was what had been happening
to Tom. When, having provided himself
with tinned meats and a bottle of the powerful
restorative which he had always on hand, he left
the camp, he had turned, by what he spoke of
afterwards as a happy instinct, into the track
which Bâl Narîn had been following, before the
strong impression of human neighbourhood and
the eccentric movements of the three birds of
prey had started him on his perilous journey
across the belt of jungle that lay between the
wild beasts' track and the hermit's hut.</p>

<p>He, too, was well-armed with light and
weapons, and he went cautiously lest he should
be taken by surprise. Suddenly the ping of
Bâl Narîn's bullet aroused him. He waited until
the echoes died away to make sure of the direction
whence the sound had come, and then dashed
into another track. He was in great doubt as to
whether he was right, for there is nothing more
confusing than the sound of firing in a wood.
The detonations repeated again and again, and
dashed, as it were, from one opposing substance
to another, seem to come from a hundred points
at once. Instead of approaching Bâl Narîn he
might be putting immeasurable distance between
them, while, on the other hand, it was quite
possible that one of a company of robbers or
fugitive sepoys had fired, in which case a deadly
conflict would be before him.</p>

<p>The prudent course would have been to
retreat while he could, to rouse his little camp,
and to take the advice of those who knew more
than he did about this dangerous region. Tom,
however, never once thought of retreating, for
he was launched&mdash;launched, as he felt even at
that moment of doubt and difficulty&mdash;on the last
stage of his enterprise; and, if hell and all its
legions had yawned at his feet, he was bound to
go on.</p>

<p>The path into which he had struck, as being
that which seemed to lead in the direction where
he had heard the firing, was comparatively easy.
As he went on cautiously, throwing the light of
his lamp in front of him, he felt surprised that he
met with so few difficulties. For a space several
yards in width the tall kutcha-grass was so completely
trodden down, and the low trees and
bushes, with their rank wealth of undergrowth,
were so uniformly levelled to the ground, that he
could have imagined an army with artillery and
baggage-waggons had passed this way. That
such a thing was impossible he knew very well,
for he had studied the map of Terai again and
again with Bâl Narîn. The maharajah's road,
which was the only one used for military purposes,
was many miles distant from the point they
had reached. But what he did not know was
that he was in the very track of the monarch of
the jungle. Eight months before, when the
plains of the north-west were at peace, and the
Terai was unhaunted by the deadly fever that,
for three-quarters of the year, makes it uninhabitable
to all but the savage Aswalias, Jung
Bahadoor, who was at that time one of the
keenest sportsmen of his generation, brought
down from the high Nepaul valley a gallant company
of hunters, mounted on tame elephants of
proved skill and sagacity, to chase and capture
some of the wild elephants that have their dwelling
in the morass and jungle, and it was along
this road that the hunters had come. A terrible
chase it was to any but men mounted and caparisoned
as they were, for the wild herd had made
it their drive. Hither they came, from the mud
in which they had been wallowing&mdash;night after
night in awful phalanx serried&mdash;to drink from a
pool in the morass, and to tear down the tall
grasses and trees on their passage, for the
succulent young shoots that made their food.
Had Tom met the dark army, he was lost. Not
even the flaming torch, which was a protection
from serpents and tigers, would have saved him.
They would have rushed over him&mdash;crushed him
into a grave, where even the birds of prey would
scarcely have found him.</p>

<p>Of this danger&mdash;the worst that had ever
threatened him yet&mdash;Tom had no more idea than
a child. He trusted for his protection to his
torch, his lamp, and his weapons, and all the
energies he had to spare from picking out his
way were bent on watching for anything that
might indicate human neighbourhood. That,
at a moment so critical, his mind should have
strayed even for an instant from the scenes in
which he found himself, seems so strange as to
be almost incredible. He was alone; he was
surrounded with unknown perils; an object
dearer far to him than the preservation of his
own life was&mdash;or seemed to be&mdash;within his grasp;
everything might depend upon the way in which
he met the next few moments; and yet&mdash;I have
it on an authority which there is no disputing&mdash;at
this point his mind began to wander.</p>

<p>He could not help it, any more than he could
have helped the curious transfusion of his own
thoughts and ideas with those of another, which
had come to him now and then since the night
when he wandered unbidden into Grace's rose-garden,
and dreamed his dream of fear. It came
suddenly too, and without, as it seemed, anything
to lead up to it. When, thinking to make a
signal to Bâl Narîn, he lifted to his lips the flute-like
reed which he always carried, and felt his
breath quiver through it, he stepped all at once
into another world. Instead of the long shrill
whistle he had intended to send forth, it was
the notes of a melody, which he had sung a
year ago, floating with oars suspended, on the
reach of the silver Thames by the lawn of the
General's little garden, that stole out on the pestilential
air of the wild beasts' haunt&mdash;'Come
where my love lies dreaming&mdash;dreaming the
happy hours away.' Was it his own voice&mdash;or
was it the voice of another? He paused and
looked round him trying to collect his thoughts.
Ah! to him too the scene is changed. What are
these&mdash;what are these&mdash;that come towards him
out of the darkness? Old hopes&mdash;old memories,
old dreams. He is the Indian rajah no longer&mdash;he
is the English boy, into whose heart the
honeyed sweetness of a new land of promise is
stealing. 'My love! my love!' under his breath
he whispers the magic words. And then again
he lifts the reed to his lips, and again the melody
that he dared to sing long ago, close&mdash;close to
his darling's rose-bower&mdash;floats out upon the air.
'Come! Come! Come where my love lies dreaming!'</p>

<p>Unconsciously&mdash;blindly&mdash;he was rushing on.
He did not hear the thunder behind him, and
the mad cries of Bâl Narîn made no impression
whatever upon his senses. Why he swerved
aside&mdash;how it came about that he should have
dashed into the jungle and precipitated himself
into the deep nullah that yawned close by, he
never knew. He thought he saw the flashing of
silver water through trees&mdash;this is the only explanation
he could ever give. But, meanwhile,
as bruised and shaken, he lay in the slime, wondering
what had come to him, and bitterly
cursing himself for his folly in not being able, at
a crisis so momentous, to keep his wits about
him, the black army that had been marching in
his rear, dashed over the spot where, but a few
moments before, he had been tranquilly walking.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It took Tom some little time to recover his
breath, climb to the edge of the nullah, and
shake off the mud from his clothes. That time,
as we know, had been spent by Grace in frenzied
prayers to Heaven, and by Bâl Narîn in no less
frenzied ejaculations and gestures. When silence
fell upon the hut and silence upon the jungle&mdash;a
silence fearfully broken by the earth-shaking
tread of the herd of elephants&mdash;when he
whistled and shouted, and fired wildly over his
head, and no one answered, he made up his mind
that all was lost. The young lord whom he had
accompanied for gain, and clung to in despite of
his own better judgment for love, had met with
a sudden and fearful death at the very moment
when his end was won.</p>

<p>Overcome for a few instants by pity and
sorrow, Bâl Narîn covered his face and wept.</p>

<p>A desire came over him then to see what was
left of his unfortunate young master, and leaving
the little clearing he plunged into the jungle.
His senses being far better trained than Tom's, he
had no doubt whatever about the direction he
should take. The last articulate sound the rajah
had made, before darkness and silence swallowed
him up, came from a point known to Bâl
Narîn, who had been one of the mahouts in
Jung Bahadoor's famous hunt, as a sharp curve
in the elephants' drive. For this point he was
making as speedily and cautiously as he could,
when a tall figure&mdash;bareheaded, and covered
from head to foot in a coating of mud&mdash;stood
suddenly before him.</p>

<p>Grasping his weapon, Bâl Narîn challenged
the man. He was answered by a voice that
made his heart leap into his mouth. 'Don't you
know me in this disguise, Billy?' it asked.</p>

<p>'Rajah Sahib'&mdash;cried the poor fellow passionately.
'Forgive me. I would have searched
for you amongst the dead. Now thank the gods
and the demons of the jungle, who have been
favourable to his Excellency!' And he fell
down before him and held him by the feet.</p>

<p>'Get up, you foolish fellow!' said Tom, who
was touched, although he would not show it, by
his devotion. 'I have fallen into a mud-bath, and
got myself into a pretty mess; but why you
should have thought me dead, I confess I don't
see. You must have come this way yourself,
since I find you here.'</p>

<p>'This way, that is true, Rajah Sahib, and
why I came only the gods know. But I kept
clear of the Elephants' Chace. I would no more
have adventured myself there than I would
have slipped my neck into an enemy's noose.'</p>

<p>'The Elephants' Chace,' stammered Tom,
'was that road&mdash;&mdash;?'</p>

<p>'It is the deadliest road in all this region
for a man not furnished as a hunter,' said Bâl
Narîn. 'And the herd has just gone by. How
his Excellency escaped is a mystery.'</p>

<p>'The herd&mdash;of what, Billy&mdash;&mdash;?'</p>

<p>'Does not my lord know&mdash;&mdash;?'</p>

<p>'I understand,' said Tom, a shiver, which he
could not control, running through him. 'Wild
elephants! My life must be valuable to some
one, Billy. Yes; I heard them. I thought it
was thunder. I must have only jumped into
the nullah in time. And I wasn't trying to
escape. Well! it is over now, so there's no use
thinking about it. I will stick to you for the
future, my good friend! Why did you separate
yourself from us last evening?'</p>

<p>'If I tell my master, he will scarcely believe
me,' said Bâl Narîn.</p>

<p>'Billy! Billy!' Tom was trembling from
head to foot. 'You have found something.'</p>

<p>'I have found those his Excellency is seeking.'</p>

<p>'What? The English lady and the child.
And in life? Billy, you are torturing me. Speak
plainly. No; no; I cannot bear it. Don't
speak at all. I shall see. And yet&mdash;where has
my manhood gone? If they are dead&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Master, they are not dead.'</p>

<p>'Not? Now Heaven be praised!'</p>

<p>'Yes; but my master must be careful. See!
there are pits here! If his Excellency goes in
so headlong a fashion, he will break his limbs,
and how will that profit his friends? Let him
follow me, and I will take him where they are.'</p>

<p>'Yes; yes; I will follow you&mdash;my good
guide&mdash;my noble guide! If all I have can
recompense you, it is yours. But it cannot.'</p>

<p>'That my master gives me his confidence
still is all I ask,' said Bâl Narîn.</p>

<p>'My confidence! I am bound to you for
ever and ever. From this day I look upon you
as the nearest and dearest of my friends. But
how, in the name of heaven, could you have
found them in this thicket?'</p>

<p>'That is a long story. Some day I will tell
my master. But truly those he loves are
favoured by the gods, for the birds and the
beasts that are their children have helped me
in my search&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>And there he broke off, for they had leapt
over the last nullah that separated them from
the clearing and the hermit's hut; and the
moon having risen and floating freely overhead,
Tom saw, as Bâl Narîn had seen before him, the
little enclosure of dried twigs and leaves; but
within there was darkness, and no one was
moving to and fro.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h5><a name="CHAPTER_XLI" id="CHAPTER_XLI">CHAPTER XLI</a></h5>

<h4>WHAT THE MORNING BROUGHT</h4>


<p>How Tom lived through the next few moments
he never knew. The next thing of which he
was distinctly conscious was standing in front of
the hut and looking within and seeing nothing
but blackness. As he groped forward with
arms extended blindly, Bâl Narîn, who had been
busy kindling another torch, came up behind
him, and the flashing light flamed suddenly
upon a spectacle that made Tom's heart stand
still, and brought a wild cry to his lips.</p>

<p>There were three figures in the small enclosure.
On one side, rigid in death, lay the
fearfully emaciated body of an old man. A
couch of dried grass was his bier, and his limbs
were covered with the long robe that he had
worn in his lifetime. On the other side, the
little heap of grass on which he lay pressed
close against the opposite side of the hut, and
as far as possible from that sight of fear, was a
child with golden hair, whose tiny face, thin and
pinched with suffering, bore upon its lips the
tranquil smile of sleep, or her twin-sister death.
This in the flashing of an instant Tom saw.
But it was not this, for all its pitifulness, that
brought the sick chill to his heart, and that
wrung from his lips that tortured cry. For he
saw something else. <i>She</i> was lying there&mdash;his
love&mdash;his darling! On the damp floor, but close
beside the couch, and with arms outspread, as
if her last conscious effort had been spent in
defending the child, she lay before him motionless.
She did not stir when Bâl Narîn's light
fell upon her. The cry of irrepressible anguish
that had broken from Tom brought from her
pale lips no answering note of recognition. It
was as he had so often dreamed it would be.
He had found her, indeed; but she was dead&mdash;dead&mdash;dead!</p>

<p>For the space of an instant he paused. Love
and a reverence that almost slew him were
waging war in his heart. He was sick with
the longing to raise her in his arms, and press
her against his breast, and breathe into her lips
of his own life and energy, and he dared not.</p>

<p>In that instant Bâl Narîn looked over his
shoulder. 'Quick, master, quick!' he cried.
'They are not dead. This is the shock of a
great joy. A few moments ago the gracious
lady was speaking to me. Bring her out under
the moonlight. And here are my chuddah and
girdle to make her a bed. You have the
cordial?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Billy; I have the cordial. Thank God
that I remembered it. So!' as he lifted up the
light form in his arms; 'gently! gently! Take
away the torch, Billy. Let there be nothing to
frighten her when she awakes! And the child,
poor little Kit! bring him out&mdash;let him be near
her! God! how light she is! My sweet one!
my love! how you must have suffered! But it
is all over now!' He laid her down reverently
on the couch that Bâl Narîn had prepared, and
wet her lips with the cordial. Then her eyelids
fluttered, and a tremor ran through her limbs,
and her lips parted in a long, shuddering sigh
that went straight to Tom's heart. He was
chafing one of her hands softly. 'My poor
love!' he whispered. 'Is it cruel to bring you
back? Have you suffered enough? But you
shall never suffer again&mdash;never, so long as I
have life and strength to protect you. Will you
not open your eyes and look at me?'</p>

<p>Her lips parted, though her eyes were still
sealed. He stooped over her and caught one
word&mdash;'Kit.'</p>

<p>'Kit is safe, darling. My good friend Billy
is with him. Ah! I hear his voice.'</p>

<p>Not his voice only. It was a little feeble
laugh that came at that moment from the door
of the hut, for Kit, who was a proficient in
children's and bearers' Hindoostani, and Bâl Narîn
were already on the best of terms.</p>

<p>'Do you hear?' said Tom. 'Do you hear
him, Grace?'</p>

<p>'Thank you,' she whispered.</p>

<p>Then her eyelids lifted, and her sweet eyes,
deep with the passion of pain and horror that,
so long as she lived, would haunt her, rested
upon his. 'You are our Tom,' she said.</p>

<p>'I am Tom. Your Tom&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I have something to tell you. It is very
strange&mdash;very horrible. I don't quite understand
it myself. Sometimes I think it is a dream;
but, if it were&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Dearest, you must tell me nothing now.
See! You are exhausted. You have suffered
so much. And we are here now, Billy and I, to
look after your little Kit and you. Let me give
you some of this cordial&mdash;it is better than food&mdash;and
then go to sleep and I will watch over you,
and in the morning, which is very near, dearest
Grace, Billy and I will carry you through the
jungle to our camp.'</p>

<p>She did as he begged her. She was as weak
as a little child, and the feeling of security,
absent from her for so many long days and
nights, was of itself enough to make her drowsy.
But before she settled herself to sleep, she
opened her eyes once more.</p>

<p>'Rungya is in there,' she whispered. 'He
died for Kit and me. You won't let the wild
birds have him?'</p>

<p>'No; Bâl Narîn shall watch.'</p>

<p>'He killed two of the birds,' said Grace.
'They were watching for us. I could not keep
them away.'</p>

<p>And then her eyelids fell, and she slept
peacefully until the morning.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Kit slept, too. He was in Bâl Narîn's arms,
just as he had thrown himself when he had
eaten biscuit and tinned meat and drunk a glass
of cordial. The guide had, in the meantime,
lighted a large fire, which blazed and crackled,
keeping effectually all the wild things away. As
he held the little one, and fed the fire with
dried grass and sticks, he and Tom were holding
a council of war. Which would be the best
plan&mdash;to carry Grace and Kit between them to
the spot where they had left the men and waggons,
or for Bâl Narîn to rush thither at once
and bring assistance?</p>

<p>Billy was for the latter alternative. He would
take an hour to go, and an hour to come back.
By the time the sun was well up they could
start together.</p>

<p>But Tom, who, since the adventure of the
previous evening, which might have had so
terrible a termination for himself, clung to his
Ghoorka guide as to a sheet-anchor of strength
and hope, was of a contrary opinion. 'Let us
keep together, Billy,' he said. 'To-night we
have both escaped from almost certain death,
and how can we expect to escape a third
time?'</p>

<p>'But, Sahib, consider&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I have considered. If there were ten
bearers I should carry her myself. And you, if
you will, shall help me. How if we contrived
a litter&mdash;&mdash;?'</p>

<p>'Out of our garments and those of the holy
man,' said Bâl Narîn.</p>

<p>'He will not want them any more&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'We must burn him, Sahib. That is the
burial for the Hindu-Saint. Before we leave
this place we will fire the hut.'</p>

<p>'Could we do it now, while they are
sleeping?'</p>

<p>'I am afraid of the flame spreading, Sahib.
With the first break of day, I will set my torch
to it, and we shall be far on our road before it
blazes high.'</p>

<p>Giving Kit over into Tom's arms. Bâl Narîn
proceeded to make his arrangements. Out of
the hermit's robe and the rajah's upper garment,
and a long straight branch from the
cotton-tree, he devised such a litter as could be
carried on the shoulders of two men: then he
took a parcel of dried twigs and grass into the
hut, scattered them over the old hermit's body,
and anointed them with oil. This done, he went
outside again, cleared from the neighbourhood
of the hut everything of an inflammable nature,
cut two or three stout stakes from the cotton-tree,
and hammered them into the ground at a
sufficient distance from the hut to allow of their
escaping from the fire that was presently to
consume it.</p>

<p>'Rungya was a holy man,' he said, in explanation,
'and the time may come when his friends
and disciples will wish to do honour to his ashes.
We leave these stakes as a signal.' By the time
all this was done the light of the morning was
beginning to peep in the east, and the wild world
of the jungle was sinking to rest.</p>

<p>'It is time for us to move,' said Bâl Narîn.</p>

<p>Tom looked down regretfully at Grace's
sleeping face. 'Couldn't we wait a little?'
he said. 'It seems such a pity to disturb
her.'</p>

<p>'We will not awake her,' said Bâl Narîn.
'Will his Excellency allow me?'</p>

<p>Tom moved aside while, with a dexterous
gentleness which he envied but could not
emulate, the clever Ghoorka, who in his youth
had served an enforced apprenticeship to a
robber tribe in the plains, transferred the sleeping
girl from her bed on the ground to her bed on
the litter.</p>

<p>Kit, in the meantime, had awoke. He was
much stronger, he said, though to Tom his poor
little legs looked piteously weak and slender. It
was possible for him, however, to walk, and when
he was tired Bâl Narîn said he would carry him
on his shoulder. Then a match was applied to
the touchwood under the hut; Grace, who had
only stirred once, was lifted slowly and carefully
to the shoulders of her bearers, and, with light
hearts, they set out to rejoin the rest of their
party on the robbers' road.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The sleep which had fallen upon Grace when
she knew that her task was done, lasted for
many hours. Passing through the air, resting
for brief spells when the shoulder of the rajah,
which was unaccustomed to weight-carrying,
threatened to give way, taken up again with
reverent care, and lifted skilfully over the various
obstructions of the way, she neither moved nor
spoke. Tom would, now and then, look at her
with alarm; but Bâl Narîn smiled.</p>

<p>'The gracious lady is a child of the Supreme
Spirit,' he said, 'and this is His sleep which has
fallen upon her. When she awakes, Sahib, her
trouble will be gone.'</p>

<p>'Grace never slept,' said Kit, who was
perched now on Bâl Narîn's unoccupied shoulder,
and holding on by his head, 'after Rungya
died.'</p>

<p>'How long was that, my little Sahib?' said
Bâl Narîn.</p>

<p>'I don't remember,' said Kit wearily. 'A
long time, I think. The big birds came and
frightened us. Grace had some candles and she
lighted them. I tried to keep awake; but I
couldn't. She kept awake always.'</p>

<p>'She is making up for it now,' said Tom
from the other side of the litter.</p>

<p>'Yes, she is sleeping beautifully,' said Kit.
'She'll be all right when she awakes, won't
she?'</p>

<p>'All right? What do you mean, Kit?'</p>

<p>'She used to look so funny&mdash;just as if she
were somewhere else. She didn't look so at first,
when that dreadful man was with us&mdash;but'&mdash;pulling
himself up, 'I mustn't say anything about
that. I promised.'</p>

<p>'No,' said Tom. 'Grace will tell us everything
herself when she awakes.'</p>

<p>What the sleep was to her&mdash;how delicious it
had been to close her eyes, and to let herself
drift away on the sea of unconsciousness that,
for these many days, had been wooing her; to
half open her eyelids just to be sure that she
had not dreamed this strange and sudden bliss,
and then to close them again; to hear, without
understanding, Kit's bird-like voice throbbing
through the air, and Tom's grave, kind answers;
to know that there was no need for her to rouse
herself, that she might sleep&mdash;sleep till the
death-like languor had gone from her limbs
and the pain about her heart was stilled&mdash;of
the rapture of all this what tongue can tell?
Only those who have passed suddenly, as I
did once, from peril and anguish, and the mad
terror of the hunted, to perfect rest and security,
can have the faintest idea of what it means.</p>

<p>It was impossible, meanwhile, that their progress
could be swift, for they could not tear
straight through the jungle as they had done the
night before; and Bâl Narîn had to make many
a detour to avoid the wild beasts' haunts.</p>

<p>When the sun rose, he rigged up a leafy
umbrella, which he fixed at the head of the litter,
and under it Grace lay like a sylvan queen being
borne in a trance to her woodland home. At
last, after three hours' steady tramp, they came
out into the robbers' road, and sighted their
waggons and horses in the distance.</p>

<p>There had been much excitement in the
camp. When they arose in the morning, and
Abiman, one of the Ghoorka soldiers, reported
that the rajah had left them shortly after moon-rise
in search of Bâl Narîn, and that neither of
them had returned, it was felt that some calamity
must have happened.</p>

<p>'This is what comes of killing a serpent,' said
Abiman to Purtab; and, indeed, Purtab's conscience
had already been reproaching him.</p>

<p>But when a swift-footed coolie, who had run
back to see if anyone was coming, rushed into
camp with the joyful news that the rajah and
Bâl Narîn were on the road, and that they carried
a litter between them&mdash;then Purtab and
Abiman changed places.</p>

<p>'The gods have won the day,' said Purtab
seriously, 'and the demons of the jungle may
mourn.'</p>

<p>Everyone knew what to do, for the rajah
had often prepared his followers for this moment.
In a trice the coolies dragged out and rigged up
the tent which was held in readiness, and the
water-carriers brought water from a neighbouring
stream and heated it in jars over the camp-fires,
and the bearers unpacked the soft cushions
and fresh garments with which Gambier Singh
had supplied Tom, and laid them out temptingly,
and toilet-appliances were hunted out from their
cases and set in order, so that before Grace, who
had been brought in and set down amongst
them, had found strength to open her eyes, her
tent in the jungle was as well-served with all
that was needful for her refreshment and comfort
as the room from which she had fled when
insurrection broke out in Nowgong. So wonderful
are Indian servants.</p>

<p>As for Tom, when he came in and looked
round, he was so glad and thankful that he would
fain have scattered, then and there, rich largesse
amongst his people; and it was fortunate, perhaps,
both for himself and his guests, that he
had nothing at that moment to dispense but
promises.</p>

<p>It was Kit who took Grace by the hand and
led her into the tent, and it was Kit who served
her with the tea and biscuits which had been
prepared for her. They were together for a
few minutes, and then he came out, and dropped
the curtain, and they saw that there was an
awed look on his little face.</p>

<p>'She is somewhere else still,' he said to
Tom; 'but I think if we don't make any noise
she will come back to us.'</p>

<p>'You are sure, Kit?' said Tom, in a broken
voice.</p>

<p>'She always came back when she could
sleep a little,' said Kit. 'Poor old Rungya used
to watch sometimes. Then he died. I will
look, in and see how she is presently,' he added,
with an encouraging nod, and then he went on
to play the hero, and to be petted and tenderly
cared for by the Indian servants.</p>

<p>They happened to be in a comparatively
wholesome region when they halted, and it was
decided, in the brief consultation which Tom
held with his followers, that they should remain
where they were for that day and part of the
next night, starting for the Maharajah's Road
with the rising of the moon. Grace and Kit
would have a cart to travel in, so, although
their progress would be slow, the fatigue would
not be great, and as there would be no need now
for any of those tentative flights into the open
spots amongst the jungle that made their former
journey tedious, they would get over the ground
more quickly. Bâl Narîn calculated that in two or
three days, at the outside, they would reach the
Maharajah's Road, at the point where they left it.
Here Tom hoped to pick up Hoosanee. It had
been arranged that if he found no trace of the
fugitives on the lower slopes of Sisagarhi, he
should return to the point where the cavalcade
had divided, and wait there a certain specified
time for his master, after which time, should no
news come, he would hasten back to Gambier
Singh, acquaint him with what had happened,
and ask his advice. It was almost certain now
that the rajah and his party would reach the
meeting-point before the time agreed upon, and
Tom's only fear was that Hoosanee, who was so
much of his friend that he longed to let him
know speedily his success and happiness, would
not be there so soon. But, in such case, a plan
for communicating with him could soon be
devised.</p>

<p>After all this, having heard through Kit that
Grace wanted nothing, the rajah and Bâl Narîn
gave themselves up to the rest which they
needed so sorely. The hours of the day rolled
on. The sun rose high in the heavens, and a
deep noontide silence, unbroken by the noises
that at dead of night and early morning make
the jungle terrible, brooded over the camp.
Everyone slept but the two or three who
remained on watch to keep the camp-fires
burning.</p>

<p>It was in the midst of this silence that the
English girl came slowly to herself. Up to this
she had been in a dream. All she had distinctly
realised was that she might rest&mdash;that the strain,
which had tried her to the utmost limit of
endurance, was over. Now, as she opened her
eyes and, by the light that stole in through the
canvas walls and closed chicks, saw the curtains
of rose and amber, and the pretty camp-furniture,
and the fresh garments, and the bowls
of clear water, she began dimly to understand
that this was not a dream, such as those that
had visited her in her wanderings, but a reality.
The gates of the dear old life&mdash;the life of safety,
and love, and reverence&mdash;were opening to her
once more. It was the horror she and Kit had
lived through that was the dream. This was
true.</p>

<p>For the first few moments her mind was too
weak to be able to take in anything more than
this: she was with her own people: she was
travelling back into the past: some day, if
God was gracious to her, she might see her
mother and her sisters again: she might give
up her darling Kit to his friends. Then, gradually,
as her mind grew stronger, the events of
the night, and of the days that had preceded it,
shaped themselves before her.</p>

<p>They had been on their way to Nepaul.
The good Rungya, who had rescued them one
night from a horde of brutal villagers, had
promised to take them thither, and place them
under the protection of the minister, Jung
Bahadoor. They had crossed the plains and
entered one of the great sâal-forests of the
Terai together. Then their cart broke down,
and the animals sickened, and word came to
them that a party of fugitive sepoys, who had
taken up robbery as a profession, were haunting
the great highway. So they turned aside,
walking painfully on foot through the jungle,
till they reached the Aswalia village. They
had scarcely left it before Kit sickened with the
fever. They carried him on between them,
hoping to reach opener ground, where they
might rest, when Rungya bethought him of
the clearing into which they turned. A holy
man, a Brahmin, who had passed through his
life's different stages, and who was preparing
himself in solitude and meditation for his eternal
rest, lived there once. Rungya had visited him
when his own life was lusty within him, and
had kissed his feet reverently as a spiritual
teacher. It could not be that the holy man
was alive still; but his hut, which even the
savage tribes of the jungle would respect, might
be standing, and it, for a few days, would afford
them shelter. Before they reached it Kit began
to mend; but Rungya was stricken down. For
two days Grace tended him as if she had been
his daughter. On the third day he died; and
then began that awful struggle between the
heroic girl and the wild things of the wilderness,
which had nearly reached its limit when Bâl
Narîn found her. How long it lasted she could
not tell&mdash;neither could Kit. When it began
they had water and rice, and faggots for firing;
when it ended their little stock was exhausted.
She dared not leave the hut so much as to cut a
stick of wood or fill her brass lota with water
at the pool. It was like a horrible siege. The
wild things without; she and her dead and
dying within.</p>

<p>Slowly and painfully her mind travelled on.
She remembered the determined attitude of the
three great birds, and her own wild tempest of
passion. She remembered vividly the ping of
the shikari's bullet, and the fall of her enemies,
and his friendly address. After that came a
terror which she only dimly recalled, and which
was followed by a blank&mdash;a peaceful falling away
into forgetfulness.</p>

<p>That she had been taken from her dangerous
position, and that she had heard Kit laughing
and talking beside her was all she knew for
certain.</p>

<p>The effort of thinking was great, and she fell
into another brief sleep. When she awoke the
day had begun to decline, and the camp was
astir. Grace was stronger. Her mind worked
fitfully. She was like one who is in search of
something, and who has a clue which makes him
believe that he will not be long in ignorance.</p>

<p>Suddenly, like a flash of light in midwinter
darkness, there rose before her a scene out of the
past&mdash;a little room, with bare mud walls and
costly furniture: in its midst an Englishwoman,
dressed in Oriental robes, and lovely as a vision,
with soft eyes and dimpled cheeks, and a little
voice like rippling waves on a pebbly shore.
She&mdash;Grace&mdash;is standing before her. Her hands
are bound; her face is stained; her garments
are dirty and ragged. How vividly she feels
the contrast between them! The lady in
Oriental robes feels it too. She laughs&mdash;not
brutally, as one who exults over a fallen enemy;
but with gushing gladness like a child. 'Dearest
Grace!' she says, 'this is shocking! What has
come to you; and where, in the name of
Heaven, is your rajah?' There is no answer.
Grace cannot speak. The little rippling voice
goes on: 'I think he is here, dear; but we
cannot let him see you. You are so beautiful.
You would turn his brain.' Silence again, and
then: '<i>Won't</i> you speak to me, you serious
young person? Am I too frivolous for your taste?
Well! but never mind. I mean to give you your
liberty, now at once! Such fun! While Tom is
in the fort expecting to see you! A friend of
your father's, one of his favourite Soubahdars,
will take care of you, and no doubt you will
reach the English lines in safety'&mdash;and then there
rises before her suddenly the wicked face with
its sinister smile&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>In a moment&mdash;in less than a moment&mdash;it
sprang before her. She had no force to go further.
There was something to be remembered
still; something horrible; something that she
would have to think out and tell before she had
peace. But this for the moment was enough.
It was the cry of her heart, the strong rapture
of conviction, which, through all the shame and
agony of those awful moments, had been present
with her, that she remembered now.</p>

<p>'Tom is looking for us! Tom will find us!'</p>

<p>Tom, then, had traced them into the jungle.
Tom had sent the shikari to slay the birds. Tom
had taken them into his keeping and was transporting
them to a place of safety. There had
been war between him and the White Ranee
and he had conquered.</p>

<p>Weary and spent with this strange flight of
memory, she sank back and closed her eyes.
But she could not rest any longer. An impulse,
dead for all these terrible days, but so much a
part of herself that even now she could not
imagine how it had ever slept, was rising up
within her.</p>

<p>Once more she opened her eyes, and this
time they fell on a mirror which an officious
servant had placed near her. She propped it up
in front of her, and gazed at herself, and a blush
of maidenly shame tinged her pale face. Was
she Grace&mdash;Grace who had been so proud and
dainty? Ah! but she had forgotten Grace.
Grace must have lived long ago in some other
world. Grace was a memory&mdash;a dream&mdash;it was
this haggard woman, with the ragged robe and
tangled hair, who was the reality. But could
not Grace come back again?</p>

<p>With a swelling heart she looked round
her. Some one had thought of this too. Everything
she could want, clear water and
English soap, and fresh and lovely garments
were in the tent. If only she had the strength,
she could, in a few minutes, make herself fit to
be seen. Slowly and painfully she rose from
her couch. How weak she was! Could it be
she, her very self, who only yesterday had withstood
the wild beasts and birds of the jungle?
When she was on her feet she staggered and
nearly fell; but she would not give up till she
had washed the stains of travel away and put
on the robe of pale blue and snowy white,
which was lying ready for her. Then, once
more, she looked into the mirror. Very white
and haggard was the face that gazed upon her,
and the eyes&mdash;oh! what was it? What was it?
She dared not look into them. There was some
awful tale; some picture of horror that would
not fade, behind their half-dropped lids; something
that was not Grace&mdash;that never would be.
And yet she was happier, more tranquil, than
she had been. The fresh water and the fair
garments had helped her to dream that she was
herself once more. She was ready to meet her
deliverer.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h5><a name="CHAPTER_XLII" id="CHAPTER_XLII">CHAPTER XLII</a></h5>

<h4>'DOES PEACE RETURN?'</h4>


<p>She saw Kit's face first. He had been sleeping
too&mdash;close to Bâl Narîn, whose large, kind
presence had, from the first, inspired him with
confidence, and now he had awoke, and his new
friend, who was one of the most versatile of
men, being as well able to nurse a child as to
snare an elephant or to kill a tiger, had taken
pleasure in washing from his face and hands the
stains of travel, and combing out his long golden
curls, and dressing him in smart new garments.
So when Kit stole in softly to see if his dearest
Grace was awake, he almost startled her by his
beauty. It was the little fine gentleman of
Nowgong, before the revolt, the adored of English
<i>burra sahib-log</i> and native servants&mdash;who
had come back. Kit was surprised too. He
stopped short just inside the tent and broke into
a little laugh. 'Who made you so pretty,
dearest Grace?' he said. 'Was it Tom? Billy
dressed me.'</p>

<p>'And who is Billy?' asked Grace.</p>

<p>'Oh! don't you know Billy. He's the
shikari that killed the birds. He's told me all
about it, and how he found us. But I must go
and find Tom.'</p>

<p>'No, no&mdash;come here first!' said Grace
softly. 'Is it quite&mdash;quite&mdash;true, Kit? Isn't it
a dream?'</p>

<p>'You can pinch me if you like,' said the
little fellow. 'I don't mind. Do you think I
look nice?'</p>

<p>'You look lovely, darling. I never saw
anything so strange. Somebody we know has
thought of everything, Kit. To think that we
should find new dresses in the jungle!'</p>

<p>'It's Tom, I know,' said Kit with conviction.
'He's a big man here, like Dost Ali Khan, only
bigger. The fellows call him the rajah. But,
I say, you mustn't keep me, dearest Grace. I
promised to let him know the very minute you
were awake. I looked in twice and you were
asleep.'</p>

<p>He gave her a hug, and ran out; but looked
back to say, with a little nod, 'They're getting
dinner ready, <i>such</i> a jolly one! Can't you smell
the cooking? Tom knows how to do it, I can
tell you.'</p>

<p>Yes: Tom certainly knew how to do it;
this Grace said to herself with a smile. But
there was a tremor at her heart all the
same. What was she to say to him? How
could she make him understand her passionate
gratitude? While she was thinking he stood at
the door, for Kit had found him close by.
'May I come in?' he said, raising the chick.</p>

<p>'Oh yes&mdash;yes; come in,' said Grace, half
rising from her couch. 'I wanted to see you;
I wanted to thank you.'</p>

<p>'And that is just what I can't let you do,'
said Tom, as quietly as he could for the furious
beating of his heart. 'Are you comfortable?'
he went on, looking round. 'Have my people
done all they can for you? If you will deign
to come with me to Gumilcund, we can do
much better; but here&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh,' cried Grace, with a little agitated
laugh; 'but it is just this that is the wonder.
It is like a miracle. How <i>did</i> you&mdash;how <i>could</i>
you have done it?'</p>

<p>'It is my best&mdash;I think it is my best,'
stammered Tom. 'I wish I could have brought
some one who knew you better&mdash;your mother, or
one of your sisters; but the way was so rough.
I was afraid of their breaking down. Is there
anything else? Am I tiring you? Had you
rather not see me until you are stronger? I
would&mdash;would <i>die</i> to give you comfort or
relief.'</p>

<p>'I know you would,' said Grace simply.</p>

<p>'Oh! thank you,' said the poor fellow in a
broken voice. 'It is infinitely good of you to
say so; and indeed&mdash;indeed it is the simple
truth. But'&mdash;trying to smile&mdash;'dying isn't of
much use, is it? If you had died, you couldn't
have saved Kit, and, if I had died, I should
never have found you. You are sure you have
everything you want?' he added, looking round
with a sort of piteousness in his face. 'I know
very little, you know, about what ladies want;
but if there is anything&mdash;these Indians are
wonderful people&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'No, no; there is nothing,' said Grace.
'Wonderful! They are <i>marvellous</i>; they can
almost create. I shall never forget what
Hoosanee was to us&mdash;' she was speaking rapidly
and in little broken sentences&mdash;she wanted to
put him at his ease; but she felt so strange herself.
'Where is he?' she went on. 'In Gumilcund,
I suppose?'</p>

<p>'Ah! poor Hoosanee!' said Tom, smiling
freely now. 'He wouldn't be left, Grace. He
fell in love with you, like everyone else; wanted
to start off at once and find you alone; but of
course, I couldn't allow that, so he came with
me. I owe it to his love and devotion that I
am here now.'</p>

<p>'Then he is in the camp. Poor brave
Hoosanee! I should like to see him.'</p>

<p>'But I am sorry to say he is not in the camp.
I sent him off to the mountains three days ago,
to search for you there. I hope he will join us
presently.'</p>

<p>'And have you been looking for me ever
since I was taken away?' said Grace.</p>

<p>'I should have looked for you till my hair
was grey and my limbs were withered, Grace.
I have found you much sooner than I thought.'</p>

<p>'It may not be so long as I think,' she
murmured. 'To-day it seems to me that ages&mdash;eternities&mdash;have
gone over my head since the
night I was carried away. This morning I was
trying to think back and&mdash;I could not&mdash;'</p>

<p>There came a pitiful agonised consciousness
into her face that frightened Tom. 'Don't,' he
said beseechingly. 'There is no need. Put all
those dreadful memories away! Let us go back,
both of us, to the dear old days. Do you remember,
Grace, our gardens that nearly touched,
and the little wicket-gate, and the river? What
a plague I must have been to you sometimes!'</p>

<p>'I think you were pretty tiresome,' said
Grace, smiling.</p>

<p>'Ah! but the girls were tiresome too.
Trixy and Maud&mdash;how they used to tease me!
And the General was just as bad. I can feel
the grip of his hand on my shoulder now&mdash;that
night he found me, what he would have called
philandering in his compound.'</p>

<p>'Father was very downright,' said Grace.
'But he liked you, Tom. I don't think there
was anyone he liked better. Dearest father!
I am afraid he must have been dreadfully
miserable about me. Ah! how often&mdash;how
often&mdash;I have wished for him&mdash;his stern look
and his strong voice&mdash;I believe he could have
frightened away any number of them.'</p>

<p>'He fought fifty&mdash;single handed,' said Tom.
'Bertie Liston came to Gumilcund and told me
about it. They had laid an ambush for him&mdash;his
own regiment&mdash;they nearly had him; but
his audacity and resource carried the day.
Some came over to his side&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'He came out of it safely?' cried Grace.</p>

<p>'With only a slight wound, and he is better.
When Bertie came to me he was nearly well.
I sent word that I hoped to find you. They are
all safe at Meerut. Our little Trixy is quite a
heroine, at least Bertie thinks so. She got hold
of a revolver and fired at one of the wretches
who were trying to get in&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'And mother?' broke in Grace. 'Is she
well? Ah! what would I not give just to see
her for a moment! Mother's dear, kind face! It
is the sweetest face in all the world.' She broke
down and covered her face with her hands, and
tears, that seemed to heal her pain, came stealing
down her pale cheeks.</p>

<p>Then Tom stole away, for he felt that she
would prefer to be alone.</p>

<p>In a few moments he sent in Kit and Bâl Narîn.
Billy was radiant in fresh white linen, and Kit
had so happy a face that Grace could not help
smiling at him.</p>

<p>'Billy won't let anyone wait upon you but
himself, dearest Grace,' he said, 'and Tom says
dinner is ready, and the sun's gone down,
and it's very nice by the camp fire. Will you
come out, or shall they bring yours here?'</p>

<p>'I will come out, Kit,' said Grace.</p>

<p>And then came the joyful buzz of the camp,
and the glowing evening light on the jungle,
and the spread table, to which the rajah led
her, his servants and camp followers bending
down humbly, with their faces to the ground,
and again she felt as if she were moving in a
dream. Though she was only able to take a
very little of what had been provided for her,
Grace felt stronger when she had eaten. Leaning
on Tom's arm, and with Kit clinging to her
hand, she was able to move about the camp.
She made the acquaintance of Purtab, who had
slain the serpent, and, using Bâl Narîn as an
interpreter, he and Abiman congratulated her
upon her escape, and expressed their conviction
that she was favoured of the gods. So long as
she was talking and moving she was at peace.
But when she was alone the horror came
again. They were not to start until moon-rise.
Tom left her in her tent to rest. Kit went
to sleep on a cushion by her side. Silence
fell upon the camp, and in the darkness and
solitude her nameless dread took form. There
she lay, with hands cramped together and staring
eyeballs, while vision after vision, full of horror,
swept by. Was it she, her very self&mdash;this Grace
who was not of heroic mould, to whom all these
things had happened? Was she dreaming hideously,
or were they true? Oh! God, were they
true? She had suffered, but it was not that alone.
She had heard what curdled her blood in her
veins, and made her feel that the gentle, innocent
gaiety of the past was a sin. Women and little
children tortured to death, men blown away
from guns, inhuman crimes, inhuman vengeance,
hell gaping its mouth to devour, and heaven, the
dear heaven, of which, in the days of her childhood,
she had dreamed, passing away as visions
pass in the lurid light of a world in flames.</p>

<p>She shuddered as she lay. This was terrible.
She ought to be so thankful. Ah! and she was
thankful; but it was to man, not God. Once
she opened her lips, and the cry, old as humanity,
the 'Our Father,' that will instinctively break
from the heart of Earth's children when they
realise their weakness and the strength of the
forces set in array against them, rose on a wave
of anguish from her soul. But in the next
instant the cry was withdrawn. Father!
There was no Father, only a blind power that
hurled the world-atoms, which for once in the
measureless ages have shaped themselves into
sentient lives, from steep to steep of a dead
eternity. Awful, unutterable, sorrow piercing
her heart, like barbed arrows, each of which
leaves its sting in the wound, looking out pitifully
from a myriad of eyes, making life impossible
and death the only refuge to be hoped
for!</p>

<p>In the darkness Kit awoke and heard her
laboured breathing. He groped for her hand,
and, finding it cold, was frightened and stole out
to awake Tom.</p>

<p>He came in, lighted the lamps, and knelt
down beside her. 'You are with friends,' he
whispered, when he had made her drink a few
drops of Bâl Narîn's cordial. 'You must have
courage for a little while.'</p>

<p>'I will try,' she said plaintively. 'I should
like to see them once more.'</p>

<p>'You will see them once more, and many
times. When all this tangle is over, we must go
back to England.'</p>

<p>'England!' murmured Grace. 'Ah! they
are good there. One can believe, but,' shuddering,
'one cannot forget. I suppose we have
to go out of life for that.'</p>

<p>'Grace, if you love us, if you love them, do
not, for heaven's sake, speak so!'</p>

<p>She raised her heavy eyes and looked at him.</p>

<p>'Poor boy!' she said softly. 'I am troubling
him. And when he has done so much for
me&mdash;all that way through the thicket! But the
others, ah! Tom, the others!&mdash;there was no God
to save them.'</p>

<p>'My dearest, in heaven's name, I beseech
you, put these thoughts away! There was a
God. There <i>is</i> a God. Death opens the way
into His kingdom.'</p>

<p>'I used to think so,' said Grace dreamily.
'That was long ago, before I knew, when I
thought the world was good.'</p>

<p>'And so it is, Grace; so it is! Give yourself
time, dearest, and you will come back to the old
thoughts. You will know that the horror which
it has pleased God to let you look upon is the
exception, not the rule. It is like the tempest
which comes and goes, and does its awful work.
Peace returns afterwards.'</p>

<p>'Does peace return?' cried the girl, fixing
her agonised eyes upon her companion's face;
'and if it does, is it a true peace? This is no
dead storm, like a storm of winds and waves.
It is a storm of human souls. The passion, the
cruelty, the restlessness, the awful, awful, unquenchable
thirst, are alive. Oh! I have seen
them again and again. It is like the look in
the eyes of the wild creatures, <i>misery and pain&mdash;misery
and pain</i>.' Her voice dropped. Into
her face came a look of horror as if some vision
long driven back were forcing itself upon her.
'How did it come?' she whispered. 'Where
does it go? It must be somewhere, even when
there is peace. Is it below us, ready, like
the wild beasts, to spring at our throats, or
does it go away? When we open our eyes
<i>there</i>, shall we see it, <i>misery and pain&mdash;misery
and pain</i>?'</p>

<p>'Grace, for pity's sake, for <i>my</i> sake,' said Tom
hoarsely, 'try to forget. For you the horror
is over.'</p>

<p>'For me, but for the others, for the world!
Did He make it? Did He give it gentle and
good things to triumph over? And what will
He do with it by-and-by? Is it to go on for
ever and ever and ever?'</p>

<p>'Don't think of it; don't think of it, Grace.'</p>

<p>'I can't help myself,' she sobbed. 'It <i>is</i>&mdash;now,
at this very moment while we are speaking&mdash;the
misery, and the cruelty, and the restlessness,
and the despair. Hark!' starting up. 'Do you
hear?'</p>

<p>'I hear the wild beasts howling, nothing else.
Abiman and Purtab are keeping the camp-fires
alight. Everything is safe. Oh! my dear!
don't look so! you frighten me!'</p>

<p>She tried to smile! 'I am so sorry,' she
said gently. 'I <i>will</i> try&mdash;yes&mdash;I <i>will</i> try to put
it all away. But I think you must let me go,
Tom. You are looking for the Grace you once
knew. You will not find her; she has gone.
The horror has touched her, and she can never&mdash;never&mdash;be
the same again.'</p>

<p>'Grace, you will break my heart. As you
are, love, as you are, with the sorrow in your
eyes and the anguish in your soul, you are
more, ten thousand times more, to me than even
then in all your dainty pride and sweetness. I
loved you, God knows I loved you&mdash;now&mdash;' he
threw himself down on his knees by her side,
'now&mdash;I adore you.'</p>

<p>'My poor boy! My poor boy!' she murmured,
touching his face tenderly, with her long
white fingers.</p>

<p>'Grace,' he whispered. 'Do you care for
me a little?'</p>

<p>'I care for you more than a little, Tom. I
love you. I have loved you from the first day
we met.'</p>

<p>'Loved me! Oh! Grace; oh! my darling!
is it true?'</p>

<p>'Hush, dear!' she said softly. 'You must
keep quiet. If we speak too loud we shall
awake Kit. Poor little Kit! He has suffered
so much. And this sleep is restoring him.'
Her voice was so quiet that it sent a chill
to his heart. There was no passion in it, no
trouble, not even the agitation, the sweet
tremulous consciousness of a woman happy in
loving.</p>

<p>There surged up in his throat a sob of uncontrollable
anguish. 'I can't even think of
Kit,' he said. 'I can only think of you&mdash;you.
Say it again, Grace&mdash;it is the dearest, sweetest
sound in all the world. Whisper it as low
as you like and I shall hear it. If I were
on earth and you were in heaven, above the
stars, myriads and myriads of miles away, still
I should hear it. Are you smiling, darling?
I can smile too now. But even you don't know
everything. I will tell you some day. Say, I
love you.'</p>

<p>'I love you, Tom; I love you.' She was
still touching his face and hair, still gazing into
his face with a tenderness that almost slew him,
it was so strangely quiet. 'I did not mean to
tell you,' she went on, 'but the time is so short.
To-morrow perhaps I shall be somewhere else.'</p>

<p>'Grace,' he cried passionately. 'Do you
wish to kill me?'</p>

<p>'No dear, I wish to live, and I think I
shall live a little while longer. I have seen you,
I must see mother and father and the girls, and
poor little Lucy, and Kit's mother, and the
others. I didn't mean that I should die, but I
may not be here. Didn't Kit tell you? I wander
away sometimes. He used to tell me about
it when I came back. "You have been somewhere
else, dearest Grace." I can hear his little
voice now. That was before Rungya left us.
Afterwards, I remembered everything till I fell
asleep and you found me.'</p>

<p>'Ah! but it was natural then. You were
in such trouble. It is a wonder to me that you
lived through it at all. But that is over!'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Grace, closing her eyes, 'all
over! all over!'</p>

<p>He watched her, his heart beating painfully.
She lay quite still, and, hoping she was asleep,
he stole to the door and lifted the chick, for in
another hour they would have to start. He
looked out, with a dazed feeling in his mind, at
the sleeping camp and the fires that were burning
brightly. He listened to the monotonous
jabber of the watchmen, and saw how the
solemn, silvery light, that would presently change
the dark jungle world into an enchanted region,
was beginning to dawn in the sky. Then he
returned to Grace, whom he found with wide-open
eyes and smiling lips. 'Is that you, Dad?'
she said.</p>

<p>'Yes, dear,' he answered.</p>

<p>'Call the girls,' she cried. 'They said they
would start early. The river is so lovely in the
morning. Is the boat ready, Dad?'</p>

<p>'Yes, dear. It is moored under the willows.
I will come for you directly.'</p>

<p>He took up Kit in his arms, and carried him
out to Bâl Narîn. Tears were in his eyes, and
the beating of his heart nearly choked him.
Grace did not know him. She was 'somewhere
else.'</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h5><a name="CHAPTER_XLIII" id="CHAPTER_XLIII">CHAPTER XLIII</a></h5>

<h4>A STRANGE JOURNEY</h4>


<p>Afterwards Tom Gregory looked back upon
this journey as one of the strangest experiences
of his strange and chequered life. As regards
outward events there is little to record. Bâl
Narîn knew every step of the way. The soldiers,
servants, camp-followers, and coolies, of whom
the cavalcade consisted, were so well up in their
duties, and so hopeful of large reward from the
rajah, that they worked with all the regularity
and much more than the intelligence of machines.
Even the heavens seemed to smile upon the
intrepid travellers, for there could be no doubt
that the air was less pestilential than is usual at this
season, while there were none of those sweeping
storms of rain that, in late summer and early
autumn, will sometimes make the roads of the
Terai impassable.</p>

<p>They travelled quietly, so as not to fatigue
Grace and Kit, and it took them three days to
work across the jungle from the robbers' path,
where Bâl Narîn had found the first traces of
the fugitives, to the Maharajah's Road.</p>

<p>This, of course, was the most difficult and
dangerous part of the journey, but they accomplished
it safely. There was no talk of fever
now, no grumbling about the denseness of the
jungle and the fatigue of the way. Bâl Narîn
issued the orders for each day, and they were
obeyed with joyful alacrity. It would almost
seem as if the gladness that had taken possession
of the camp since Grace and Kit were
found had given it strength and tone. But
for all this, and in spite of the kind and gracious
face he showed to his followers, the
young rajah carried about with him an aching
heart. His hope and dream had not been fulfilled.
He had saved his love from the last
extremity; but for what had he saved her?
Sometimes when he saw the wandering horror
in her eyes, when he listened to the broken
words of pain, which for his sake she tried to
repress, when, with a trouble which almost
unmanned him, he realised that so it must be
as long as she lived, he would say to himself
ruefully, that for her it would have been better
if in the trance in which he found her in the
hut, her gentle spirit had winged its flight from
earth.</p>

<p>But these were his worst moments. The
best times were when, as Kit expressed it, Grace
was 'somewhere else.' Then, but for the
curious expression of her eyes, the haunting
pain that seemed always to be lying in wait for
her, she was so quiet and peaceful, so much
the Grace of the dear old days, that he could
venture to hope for her restoration to health
of body and peace of mind.</p>

<p>He would lengthen out these times of mental
aberration. When she called to him by some
name out of the past, he would answer to it.
Patiently he would work himself into the spirit
of her dream, so that he might live and act in
it. With an ingenuity born of love, he would
keep out of her sight, as much as possible,
everything that would remind her of the present.
Kit was not allowed to come near her while the
dream lasted. The servants were kept in the
background. Of everything strange that she
saw about her, there would be some ingenious
explanation. Thus the meal under the shadow
of a tree was a picnic; and the jungle was
an English wood, and the tent was a cottage in
which they had taken shelter from heat or
storm, he and she together, and the others&mdash;Lady
Elton and Mrs. Gregory, and Lady Winter and
the fine Sir Reginald, and the girls&mdash;these were
all behind them and would presently come up.
So in the hours of tranquillity, which his love
made for her, she gained marvellously in health
and strength; but Tom had an uneasy feeling
that the spectre of pain and horror which she
carried about with her was not destroyed, and
that some day it would assert its presence
dangerously. The fact was, that Grace lacked
the robust individualism which enables the
majority of people, and especially of women, to
exult over their own exceptional good fortune.
She could not feel herself a favourite of heaven;
she could not, as she would say pathetically, be
grateful. That thought of the others, the ill-doers
as well as those who had suffered wrong,
haunted her perpetually. She saw them in her
dreams. They seemed to be holding out their
hands to her. Whenever she was not wandering
in the past, her heart was full of a new and
incomprehensible anguish.</p>

<p>A little diversion, which had a beneficial
effect upon her mind, was created by their meeting
with Hoosanee. It was in a great sâal-forest,
when they were travelling pleasantly along an
easy road, under a fine canopy made by overarching
trees, that the rajah's faithful servant,
who had made up his mind that no such fugitives
as those he was seeking could have crossed
Sisagarhi, came up with them.</p>

<p>He came in late in the evening, when the
cavalcade had halted as it did habitually between
sunset and moonrise. The blow on the hillside
had done for him what his master had hoped
from it. The fever that had begun to work in
his blood had gone, and his power and energy
had returned. The meeting between him and
the rajah was rather that of intimate friends
than of master and servant. When Hoosanee
heard that the object of the expedition had been
fulfilled, that the fair and gracious maiden
whom they had travelled so far, and on his part
so hopelessly, to seek was actually in camp,
he cried like a child. 'Master! Master!' he
sobbed, the tears rolling down his face. 'Who
will dare to tell me now that the gods do not
fight on our side? Ah! if some miracle would
take us straight to the gates of our own town!
How proudly we shall enter! It will be better
even than the night when first the Rajah Sahib
passed through our streets and the people saluted
him as Rama, their prince and hero&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'That remains to be proved, Hoosanee,'
said Tom, smiling. 'Remember that I have
offended the people of Gumilcund grievously. I
doubt whether they will accept me as their rajah
now. But I am sure that, for the love of those
who have gone, they will admit me for a time.
And I have been mindful of their interests while
I was away. Is it not strange, Hoosanee,' he
went on dreamily, 'now I have fulfilled my
task the love of my people and my work has
come back to me? The voice that was silent so
long spoke to me again last night. I am one of
you, my friend, as I was before. You are so
near to me that you will understand this. But
we must not be surprised if the others do not.'</p>

<p>'They will: they will. Chunder Singh knows.
Chunder Singh is the friend of his Excellency.
There is no fear,' said Hoosanee joyfully.</p>

<p>Then he left his master and presented himself
at the door of the tent where Grace was
resting. Kit was just outside. He saw him and
gave a joyful cry of recognition. Grace heard it
and started up. 'Who has come? What has
happened?' she cried.</p>

<p>'Oh!' said Kit, rushing in, 'it's Tom's bearer.
It's Hoosanee. They did not kill him after all.
Hooray! Hooray! Three cheers! Grace! Grace!
mayn't he come in?'</p>

<p>'Yes! Yes; bring him in,' said Grace joyfully.
So Kit set the curtain aside, and Hoosanee,
whose dark face was glowing with happiness,
came in, and stood with bowed head and hands
crossed reverently before the lady of his dreams.
As for Grace, she held out both her hands and
burst into tears.</p>

<p>'My gracious lady should laugh: she should
not weep,' he said, bending low over her hands.</p>

<p>'But it is for joy not for sadness. My brave
Hoosanee, I never thought to see you alive
again. How splendidly you stood your ground
that awful night, and how nobly you pleaded for
me! And did you take care of the others? Did
you carry them to Gumilcund safely?'</p>

<p>'Missy Sahib,' said Hoosanee, a smile breaking
over his face, 'it was not so easy when you
had gone. The ladies cried and sometimes they
were unreasonable and doubted me, thinking
that, as I had given you up, so I would give them
up; and the storm beat upon us angrily, and
it was with difficulty we dragged ourselves along.
But on the second night we entered the gates of
our city and one ran to tell our rajah and he
met us.'</p>

<p>'And they were safe and well&mdash;Lucy and
Kit's mother, and the baby and the other Mem
Sahib?'</p>

<p>'They were safe. The rajah gave them lodging
in his palace. But we did not see them again,
for that very night we departed for the fort.'</p>

<p>'The fort? Dost Ali Khan's fort?' said
Grace shuddering. 'That was where the wicked
Soubahdar took me. But how did you know,
Hoosanee?'</p>

<p>'It had been told to one of my lord's
servants that we should find Missy Sahib there.
Dost Ali Khan thought to buy the favour of
my master by giving her up.'</p>

<p>'But I was not there, Hoosanee.'</p>

<p>'Let us give thanks to the Supreme Spirit!'
said the Indian, bowing low.</p>

<p>Grace gazed at him, speechless with wonder.</p>

<p>'The fort has gone,' he went on solemnly.
'Like a wild beast in its lair Dost Ali Khan was
destroyed. The day after Missy Sahib was put
out the English came up, and they made a mine
secretly and the fort was blown to pieces.'</p>

<p>'With everyone within,' said Grace, whose
eyes were distended with horror.</p>

<p>'My master and my master's servants
escaped. Some few of the defenders may have
left by the secret passage. All the others
perished.'</p>

<p>'There was an English woman there,' said
Grace.</p>

<p>'The woman who called herself the White
Ranee, and to whom Dost Ali Khan the pretended
ruler of the country did homage, was
within the fort. She was slain,' said Hoosanee
quietly.</p>

<p>'Slain!' echoed Grace.</p>

<p>'It is true, Missy Sahib. The rajah himself
brought her dead out of the ruins. I saw her
in his arms. He made a fire in the room where
they had imprisoned him, and her body was
consumed. Then he and I went out to meet
the English.'</p>

<p>While Hoosanee was speaking, Grace had
covered her face with her hands. When she
looked up she was as pale as death. 'Dead!'
she murmured, 'Vivien dead! Is it true? Then
God have mercy upon her!'</p>

<p>She paused. Hoosanee did not speak, and
after a few moments she went on, in a stifled
voice, as if she were speaking to herself: 'I
had been thinking of her, wondering how it
would end. But it is best so&mdash;much best!
Hoosanee,' suddenly, 'you must tell no one.
Remember! It is a secret between you and
me and the rajah.'</p>

<p>'I will remember, Missy Sahib.'</p>

<p>'Let them think that she was taken
prisoner,' went on Grace. 'It may have been
so. Yes: that is the true explanation. I
wonder I did not think of it before&mdash;and the
terror and horror shook her reason. Poor
Vivien! I am sorry I had hard thoughts of her.
She was much too beautiful to be wicked. It
was madness, Hoosanee. If she had not been
mad she would never have treated me so. I
might have known it at once. And you say
she is dead?'</p>

<p>'She is dead, Missy Sahib.'</p>

<p>'It was best. To have come to herself here
would have been terrible. But I cannot think
of it any more. Thank you for telling me, my
good Hoosanee. You have just come in?'</p>

<p>'I rode into camp an hour ago, Missy Sahib.'</p>

<p>'You must want rest. I am selfish to keep
you up so long. Good-night! I will see you
again to-morrow.'</p>

<p>'May the sleep of my gracious lady be
sweet, and may the gods preserve her from
evil!' said Hoosanee fervently.</p>

<p>He went out, to find the rajah waiting for
him with eager questions. Then Bâl Narîn
joined them. A runner had come out in search
of the rajah. He brought intelligence of a
great and notable Ghoorka victory, which had
resulted in the complete pacification of the
district between the Nepaul frontier and the
Kingdom of Oude. Gambier Singh was triumphant.
He sent word that the rajah must join
him in his camp near Janhpore, and that he
would tell off a detachment to escort him to
Gumilcund, as a part of the Doab, which he
would have to cross on his journey, was said to
be still in an unsettled condition.</p>

<p>When questioned about the state of the
country generally, the runner reported that
Delhi was supposed to have been taken by
assault a few days since; but that Lucknow
was still in the hands of the mutineers.</p>

<p>This was joyful news to the rajah. 'If
Delhi is taken the worst is over,' he said to his
servants. 'And our Gumilcund men will be in
it. If we reach our city safely, I will put myself
at the head of another little army and join
the forces that will be marching to Lucknow.
What do you say, Billy? Will you join
me?'</p>

<p>'I will go to the ends of the earth with his
Excellency,' said Bâl Narîn. 'But let him have
a care!'</p>

<p>'Of what, Billy?'</p>

<p>'Of the jealousy of the gods, Excellency.'</p>

<p>'You think I am too prosperous, Billy?
Don't alarm yourself. I shall have my knock-down
presently.'</p>

<p>'It is useless to speak of such things,' said
Hoosanee. 'The Rajah Sahib, as we know,
has risked his life in two dangerous enterprises.
It is fitting now that he remains with his
people in Gumilcund.'</p>

<p>'Time enough to discuss our further movements
when we have reached that haven of
rest,' said Tom, dismissing them with a wave
of his hand.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And so, when the moon rose that night, they
went on together joyfully. One more halt in
the Terai, and a short day's march through the
forest brought them to the borders of the
dominions of the Maharajah of Nepaul, when
they entered upon the vast agricultural plains
of Upper India, held then by the British and
Ghoorka armies.</p>

<p>Concerning this part of the journey, which,
under any other circumstances, would have
been monotonous, there is very little to record.
The rajah's diary, to which he returned about
this time, deals more with feelings and states of
mind than with events. I gather from it that,
as the days went by, his deep interest in the
social and political condition of the people
amongst whom his lot had been cast revived.
He was impatient, for his own sake as well as for
that of his friends, to be in Gumilcund again.
He took a more wholesome and a larger view of
life. Away from the pestilential swamps of the
fever-haunted jungle, and under the wide benignant
sky, he could forget the wild agony of despair
that for so many days had bound him in
prison; he could believe that it was not madness,
but a sound philosophy, which caused men
everywhere to expect and to work for the
redemption of humanity.</p>

<p>Here and there he speaks of Grace, but only
briefly. 'My darling is better,' he writes on
one occasion. 'I think Hoosanee is doing her
good. He understands how to make her comfortable.
I really think she is at home in her
tent.' And again, 'There is something on her
mind still. If she could tell it, the look of
haunting terror, which goes to my very soul,
might leave her eyes. But I dare not urge her.'
And yet again, 'A woman should be with her;
one she has known and loved. Thank God she
will find friends at Gumilcund! Perhaps her
mother would come if I sent for her. She will
not be happy until she has told what is on her
mind. Will she then? God help my darling
and send her rest and peace!' From Bâl
Narîn, who would not go back to his native
valley until he had seen his friends at the end
of their journey, I learn that the young rajah,
who travelled in semi-Oriental dress, but who
did not now disguise from anyone that he was of
European origin, won hearts wherever he went
by his grace and dignity. To this day most of
these people believe that there was something
supernatural about him. At the villages, when
there was difficulty about the supplies of food
and firing, he had only to come forward and
speak and his orders were obeyed without delay.
To himself his power over the native mind, which
he could not help seeing and acknowledging, was
a mystery. I, who look at this part of his
history in the light not only of what went before
but of what followed, can find an explanation.
In him the indomitable pluck, the perseverance,
the rectitude, and stern sense of justice, which
have enabled a Western people to conquer and
hold dominion in the East, were combined with
the softer, more graceful and endearing qualities
of the race with which he was allied, although
at that time he did not know it, no less by birth
than by circumstances. Gracious as well as
great, sympathetic as well as strong, feeling at
every point the people with whom he came in
contact, tolerant in them of the weaknesses,
whose germs, covered but not destroyed by his
Western training, he found in himself, yet,
rising above them by his proud indifference
to selfish considerations, his quickness to execute
what his brain had devised; and, more
than all, by his keen spiritual insight, Thomas
Gregory has always seemed to me to be in himself
a living parable. So in my fanciful moments
I have imagined may society be, when the two
great branches of humanity's noblest family,
which have been separated so long, will consent
not only to meet, but to meet on the same
ground; when they will take one from the other
as brothers should; when they will sit down
together at the rich feast of stored-up experience
wrought out painfully on the opposite sides of
dividing oceans; when they will realise that one
requires the other, and that only from sympathy
and mutual concession can spring the union, out
of which, as some of us hope, a perfectness such
as the world has never known will grow.</p>

<p>But this is in the future still; and our present
business is with the rajah on his march to Gumilcund.
They made a slight detour to visit Gambier
Singh in his camp near Janhpore; and I am told
that the greeting they received from that
magnificent young officer was of the warmest.
He was highly elated with his own success, concerning
which he had much to say to his friend,
while his delight and admiring sympathy over the
happy accomplishment of the feat, which when
they met before he had judged to be impossible,
were inexhaustible. During the few hours they
spent together in the young Captain's tent Tom
had to give over and over again his account of
the various incidents of their journey. Then
Bâl Narîn was called in to receive his meed of
praise and substantial reward, which he did
modestly, asserting that he was but an instrument
in the hands of the gods and demons, who
were bent upon honouring the Rajah Sahib.
Finally, having hinted at his wish to be thus
distinguished, Gambier Singh was introduced
to Grace, who thanked him in graceful and
touching words for the assistance he had
rendered to her friends in their search. It happened
to be one of her best days. She was conscious
of everything that went on around her,
and the hope of being in Gumilcund soon, of
seeing her friends, and gladdening their hearts
with the news of her deliverance, although it
could not lift from her face the shadow that
rested there continually, gave to her an
expression of tremulous anticipation that was
curiously pathetic. This, with her delicacy of
form, her low voice and gentle manner, and the
white purity of her perfect face, made an undying
impression on the mind of the chivalrous
young soldier. When, accompanied by his
friend the rajah, he left the English girl's tent,
his dark face was glowing with a new
enthusiasm. 'A few days ago, my brother,' he said,
grasping Tom's hand, 'I could not understand
you. Now it is clear to me. She is a fair and
noble woman&mdash;one for whom a true man would
willingly lay down his life. That I have been
able to help you to save her will be a joyful
memory to me as long as I live.'</p>

<p>Later he said, meditatively, 'Is she a type?
Are there many like her in England?'</p>

<p>'There are many as beautiful, and true, and
courageous,' answered Tom. 'Although to me,
naturally, she stands alone.'</p>

<p>'Then I can understand your greatness,' said
Gambier Singh.</p>

<p>'You must visit us and see our women at
home,' answered Tom with a smile.</p>

<h4>MORE FUGITIVES IN GUMILCUND</h4>


<p>They could not spend more than a day and
a night in Gambier Singh's hospitable camp.
Moreover, the gallant little Ghoorka army had
work to do. It had been reinforced by English
officers and troops, and it was bound on an expedition
south to cut off the retreat of a body of
rebels who, having escaped the swords and
guns of Havelock's Highlanders, were rushing
up to hide themselves in the mountains. But
Gambier Singh, with the full consent of his
fellow officers, both British and Nepaulese,
would not let his friends depart unattended. An
escort, sufficiently strong to make them respected
both by insurgent villagers and fugitive sepoys,
was told off to protect them on their further
journey, and he added to their travelling stores
such comforts as he could command.</p>

<p>Both parties, the English rajah, with his
Nepaulese escort, and the Ghoorka army,
started with light hearts, for there could be no
doubt now that the tide of affairs in the peninsula
had changed for the better. Delhi was taken
by assault; the news was in every mouth. The
King of Delhi was a captive; his army was
scattered and destroyed; and although, while
Oude was in insurrection, and Lucknow was in
the hands of the rebels, and a vast army
reinforced by the mutinous contingent from
Gwalior still held the field, the mutiny could
not be said to be crushed, there was good hope
now of a successful issue to the efforts which had
been made to extinguish it.</p>

<p>With the intelligence from Delhi, which was
brought by swift runners to the Ghoorka camp,
Tom had the satisfaction of receiving a good
account of his Gumilcund levies. They were
specially mentioned as having distinguished
themselves in the assault. What he did not
know then, but what he heard later, was that
these men of Gumilcund had earned the praise
even of the heroic Nicholson. On the day after
the assault, when the gallant English soldiers,
who had fought like lions and shed their blood
like heroes, fell prone to the temptation thrown
in their way by their enemies, and lay about,
stupid as sheep, in the streets and courts of the
city they had so brilliantly won, it was a band
of Gumilcund men, who, by their steadfastness
and intrepidity, prevented the day of dishonour
from being, to many of them, a day of
disaster.</p>

<p>This the rajah heard at Gumilcund, whither,
as there is nothing in his further journey to
deserve a special record, we must now return.</p>

<p>The English ladies in the palace had settled
down, as we shall remember, into a peaceful and
well-cared-for, if somewhat monotonous, life.
They never went out into the streets of the city.
This was by the advice of Chunder Singh and
Lutfullah, who feared that the people, looking
upon them as, in some sort, responsible for the
loss of their rajah, might show signs of hostility
if they appeared amongst them. As for those
grave personages themselves, they had overcome
their first feelings of doubt and suspicion.</p>

<p>By the time of which I am speaking the
rajah's message from the village in the Doab,
where he halted to rescue the English prisoners,
and received the intelligence which sent him to
Azimgurh and Nepaul, had arrived. It had
been immediately obeyed. Before Grace and
Kit were found Mrs. Lyster shared the hospitality
of the English rajah's palace, and the two young
officers, who had so narrowly escaped an
ignominious death, were resting and recruiting
their strength in the Resident's comfortable
house.</p>

<p>This message had brought hope back to the
city. Their rajah had not completely deserted
them. He sent word that he would return, that
wherever he went he was mindful chiefly of their
interests, that he would die rather than betray
them; and they believed him. Over the common
people, in fact, to whom the contents of
this letter was made known, his influence was
rather strengthened than weakened by what
had taken place. His mysterious departure, his
extraordinary escape out of the hands of Dost
Ali Khan the deadly enemy of Gumilcund, with
the destruction of the fort, from which the city
and State had so often been threatened, confirmed
their belief that the gods were in league
with their rajah, and that, while he continued
to rule over them, peace and prosperity were
assured to the State.</p>

<p>And in fact this small principality was, at the
time of which I am writing, like one of those
islands in the Southern Seas which awful coral
reefs guard from the onslaught of stormy waves.
To her very doors the tempest raged. From
east and west, from north and south, the posts,
which had again begun to run, brought news of
mutinous armies in possession of the country,
of burning villages and sacked cities, of robber-tribes
pursuing unchecked their career of
violence, and of peasants fleeing from their unreaped
fields. She remained untouched&mdash;a fortress
and a refuge.</p>

<p>In the palace things were not so dull as they
had been. Chunder Singh and Lutfullah paid
daily visits to the ladies, to assure themselves
that they wanted for nothing. The message
from the rajah and the arrival of Mrs. Lyster
raised their drooping spirits. Mrs. Durant began
to hope that she might one day see her darling
Kit again, and Lucy was better able to excuse
herself for what she still looked upon as her own
cowardly desertion of her cousin and friend.</p>

<p>As for Mrs. Lyster, I am afraid it would take
more space than I have at my command to do
anything like justice to her feelings. When,
after her long and toilsome journey, she was
carried within the precincts of the palace, and
her litter being set down in the cool marble
court of the quarter allotted to the European
ladies, she found herself surrounded with gentle
and sympathetic faces, she was as one in a dream.
Long after, as she has told me since, it abode in
her mind like a picture in a vision. There were
little Lucy, with her pure white skin and golden
hair and pathetic eyes, from which the dream of
horror had not yet passed away; and the pale-faced
mother eager&mdash;so eager&mdash;for news, yet not
venturing to ask a question until the haggard,
wild-eyed visitor had been refreshed and comforted;
and Aglaia, like a child-angel with love
and wonder in her face, and close to her the
dusky-faced Sumbaten, pouring out broken
words of welcome and offers of assistance; and
little Dick, rosy and sweet, at sight of whom the
poor fugitive covered her face with her hands
and wept. Her baby had been shot&mdash;her soft
innocent little darling&mdash;shot, in the arms of its
father, who had torn it from the ayah to protect
it with his own body. And then he had fallen
too, and when, cold and still as lifeless stone, she
leant over them to staunch their life-blood, he
whispered to her hoarsely, 'For the sake of our
children in England, escape!'</p>

<p>She had escaped&mdash;oh, God! she had escaped!
But was not life far bitterer than death?</p>

<p>They knew how it was with her. Everyone
of them had gone through her hour of worse
than martyrdom, so they waited silently till she
looked up again and made a pathetic effort to
smile and thank them; and then Aglaia, who,
having been the first comer, continued to do the
honours of the palace, took her by the hand,
and Aglaia's ayah followed, and she was given
clear water and fresh garments, and when she was
ready she was brought out again to the rajah's
summer-house, where an English tea, with tinned
meats and wheaten bread, and luscious Eastern
fruits, was spread out.</p>

<p>It was then, as she has told me, that her
perplexity began. She was asked a number of
questions which she could not answer. Aglaia
stood up before her, and besought earnestly to
be told where Daddy Tom was, and why he did
not come back, and when, thinking naturally
the poor child was asking for one of the dead,
she said that she had not seen him, Lucy interposed
quickly: 'Oh! she means the rajah; don't
you know? He sent you here.'</p>

<p>'The rajah! Daddy Tom!' echoed Mrs.
Lyster.</p>

<p>'Of course you know he is an Englishman,'
said Lucy.</p>

<p>'It was no Englishman saved us,' said Mrs.
Lyster, shaking her head. 'Ask the others!'</p>

<p>'Oh! but it was; it was Tom. I think his
second English name is Gregory. It's a funny
story. Grace told me part of it,' said Lucy,
'and I heard the rest here. Surely he told
you about Grace&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'And about Kit, my sweet Kit, my little
hero!' said Mrs. Durant, weeping.</p>

<p>'Grace! Kit! I don't understand. I think
indeed we must be playing at cross-purposes.
God knows it would give me the truest happiness
to relieve your anxieties: you who have
received me so kindly. But what can I tell you
but the truth? We were saved by an Indian
prince, a young man. He came to see us in the
headman's hut, late at night, after he had killed
twenty of our captors with his own hand. He
told us he was the rajah of this place, and he
would send us here with soldiers of his own.
But, Tom&mdash;Thomas Gregory! what do you
mean?' cried Mrs. Lyster, in great agitation.
'I knew an Englishman of that name once.'</p>

<p>'But you don't, you <i>can't</i>, mean to say that
you know nothing more!' said Lucy. 'Think,
for heaven's sake! Try your hardest to remember.'</p>

<p>'Try to remember? Do you think I could
forget? In the depths of our despair, I and those
two poor boys, who were dying under my eyes;
not knowing what fresh horrors each fresh day
might have in store for us; living on and praying
to a God who, we still believed, was a God of
Mercy, to let us die swiftly, and our pains and
troubles end; all at once, in a moment, at dead
of night, dragged out to what we thought must
be the swift and sudden death we had prayed
for; and then to find ourselves safe, our bonds
loosened, our enemies gone, kind and gracious
friends about us, with words of hope which
have been fully&mdash;fully redeemed upon their
lips! Forget! we should be monsters of ingratitude
if we forgot. If I could ever return it,
ever show&mdash;but that would be impossible,' cried
Mrs. Lyster wildly.</p>

<p>'Yes, impossible,' said the ladies together.
And Lucy added softly, 'Tom has been our
good angel. But it was for Grace's sake. We
must not forget that. He sent for us because
of her. Do you know, all of you, she might
have escaped alone, long before, and we, God
only knows where we should have been! He
was searching for Grace when he rescued you,
Mrs. Lyster; he is searching for her still. Most
likely she is dead, and then he will die too!'</p>

<p>'Oh! Lucy! Lucy! Don't talk so wildly!'
said Mrs. Durant. 'Look at Aglaia and think
of me! You are frightening Mrs. Lyster.'</p>

<p>'I am not frightened,' said the poor lady,
'only bewildered. My Thomas Gregory was
such an interesting boy. At least, we thought
him so at first. Then some one said he was
more than half a native. There was a curious
story about him,' she went on gropingly. 'He
was going out, they said, to inherit the wealth
of an Indian rajah. Dear! how strangely things
come round. If'&mdash;with a little laugh&mdash;'I had
only known he was Thomas Gregory&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Was he going on with his search?' said
Lucy.</p>

<p>'Yes; and now I think of it, I must have
given him a clue. His servant questioned
me!'</p>

<p>'Hoosanee, our good Hoosanee!' cried Lucy,
clapping her hands.</p>

<p>'He struck me as being rather artful,' said
Mrs. Lyster.</p>

<p>'So he is, but it is in his master's service,'
said Lucy joyously. 'Hoosanee is a man of
resource. I am sure they are safe now.'</p>

<p>'God grant it!' said poor Mrs. Durant,
breaking into tears and sobs. 'If he were not
such a darling&mdash;much too good for this world&mdash;I
might hope too! Oh! Kit, my poor Kit, my
pretty Kit, I can see your brave little face now
as you went away! How I kept still I don't
know. I was paralysed.'</p>

<p>'If Grace had been paralysed, we should
none of us have been here to tell the tale,' said
Lucy, with a sort of disdain, which was as
much for herself as for these others, on her pale
face.</p>

<p>'How she found strength to do it I can't
imagine,' said little Dick's mother. 'But for
baby&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh!' interposed Lucy, 'we all had our own
reasons, of course. As a fact, I believe we
couldn't have done any differently!'</p>

<p>'It is all very mysterious,' said Dick's
mother; 'but I don't see why you should be so
sardonic about it, Lucy. We ought to be
thankful that our lives are spared. I am sure I
am, both for myself and dear little baby.'</p>

<p>'Don't! Don't!' cried Lucy passionately.
'You hurt me! Thankful! How can I be
thankful? Till Grace and Kit are here beside
me, I shall not be thankful. I know I am
wicked; but I can't help myself. It's in me.'
And then she turned away, and gripped Aglaia
by the arm. 'Come!' she said, '<i>you</i> won't
reason with me or try to make me good. Let
us find Sumbaten, and see what she is doing for
Mrs. Lyster!'</p>

<p>They looked after her, as with a defiant
step she went away along the avenue, and Mrs.
Durant sighed deeply, while Dick's mother
shook her head, and said that Lucy's temper
did not improve. It was a pity they could not
see her more subdued and humbled. As for
Mrs. Lyster, she sat very silent. She was gazing
out into the soft rose lilac of the narrowing
heavens, and thinking of the young fellow who
had been her companion on that delightful
voyage, that seemed now so long ago&mdash;the
young fellow whom she had liked and admired
until a certain strange day, when he mystified
her and others by putting on an Oriental robe,
and assuming, with such marvellous perfection,
the speech and manners of an Oriental grandee.</p>

<h4>NEWS OF MEERUT&mdash;GENERAL ELTON FINDS A
NEW SPHERE</h4>


<p>The message from the rajah and Mrs. Lyster's
arrival did, as I have said, revive the drooping
spirits of the ladies in Gumilcund; but many
weary days and nights were destined to go by
before they could receive certain news of their
friends. In the meantime the posts, which ran
now with tolerable regularity, brought them a
variety of intelligence&mdash;some of it depressing;
but, for the most part, tending to hope. That,
though the North-West had failed in preparedness
for the crisis, the gallant rulers of the Punjaub
had not only held their own, but were
pouring down reinforcements to the army before
Delhi, while from Bombay, Calcutta and Allahabad
men and munitions of war were being
marched up country, Chunder Singh told them
with exultation. Delhi, he was sure, would not
long hold out, and then, as he too sanguinely
believed, the insurrection would be at an
end.</p>

<p>They received private intelligence too.
Strange and pathetic, as some of us will remember
very well, were the letters exchanged
between friends and relatives in those strange
days. You would mourn a dear friend as dead,
and then, all of a sudden, one wonderful morning
you would see a letter in his well-known handwriting;
and when, with beating heart, feeling
as if a missive had come to you from the grave,
you would tear it open, you would find that your
friend had given up you as lost, and was writing
to you joyfully as one brought back from the
jaws of death. These were the bright spots&mdash;the
red-letter days&mdash;in that time of anguish. Of
those other letters which brought no joy, only
a fearful confirmation of our worst fears&mdash;the
letters which told us of the tender hunted to
death&mdash;of the fair and fragile giving way under
the awful strain of horror, and sleeping, as we
fondly believed, in the bosom of their God&mdash;of
the beautiful, the strong, the noble cut off in the
flower of their youth and the plenitude of their
service&mdash;yes, of these, too, we carry about with
us memories, and the bitterness of those memories
will never fade until we meet our beloved
on the further shore. Of news such as these
there is happily no question here. Mrs. Durant
heard of her husband. He had escaped from
Nowgong by the skin of his teeth, having been
surrounded and actually imprisoned for a season
by a body of his own men who, though pledged
to the mutineers, were unwilling to injure him
personally. Mrs. Lyster knew of her own the
very worst. Little Dick's father had been
summoned to Allahabad shortly before the outbreak
at Nowgong, and joyful news it was to
him that his wife and son were safe at loyal
Gumilcund. Lucy was encouraged by letters
from Meerut, and she sent back such encouragement
as she could. Tom&mdash;<i>they</i> would know who
Tom was&mdash;had left everything and run the risk
of rebellion in his wonderful little State, which
Lucy remarked parenthetically was like the
Garden of Eden before the Fall, just to search
for Grace and Kit. He had not come back; but
he had been heard of, and it was the belief of
everyone that he would succeed, so she begged
her uncle, and aunt, and cousins to keep up their
spirits and to hope for the best.</p>

<p>They smiled when they read the fly-away
letter. It was like herself; but it was not very
satisfactory to them. And indeed the family
were in miserable case just then. General
Elton, who had barely recovered from the effects
of his wound, was about again; and it may be
that the bolder counsels which began from this
time to prevail in Meerut were due in large
measure to his advice and assistance. But he
himself was, if that were possible, a greater
anxiety to his friends than when he had been
lying at the point of death, for then they at least
knew the worst. Now his restlessness and
irritability were such that they could never for a
single instant be sure of him.</p>

<p>Accustomed as he had been to take a large
share in the conduct of affairs, his personal
inactivity galled him. He had no civil authority,
and the collapse of the magnificent army with
which for so many years it had been his pride
to be connected, had deprived him, at a stroke,
of his military occupation. Meanwhile the
state of anarchy, into which the province was
falling, cut him to the soul, the more so that
he felt convinced something might be done to
check it.</p>

<p>With the Asiatic nothing goes so far as
audacity, a quality which he cannot understand,
and, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, does
not believe in. Where he sees unflinching boldness,
he suspects hidden strength, and as often
as not he will throw down his arms rather than
have them forced from him. So the General
was never tired of preaching, but for some time
no one would listen to him.</p>

<p>Then there came a change. From the hills,
where, when the storm broke, he had been
enjoying his well-earned holiday, the gallant
collector, Dunlop, came down. He was armed
with the authority of a magistrate over the
districts surrounding Meerut, and, to the surprise
of everyone, he asserted his determination
of exercising it without delay. He would march
out alone if no one cared to join him, and it
was his belief that the terror of the English
name, reinforced by the outcries of the unfortunate
people, whose lands had been ravaged by
a brutal soldiery, would carry him along.</p>

<p>Dunlop was one of those Englishmen who
believed in audacity.</p>

<p>But if a few volunteers amongst those whom
the breaking up of the old order had deprived
of occupation would put themselves under his
orders, there could be no doubt that the pacification
of the country would be more easily and
swiftly accomplished.</p>

<p>We may imagine, but it would be very
difficult to describe, the effect of this announcement
on the fiery soul of the old General. As
a war-horse that scents the battle-field afar off;
as a Moslem soldier, who sees the pearly gates
of his Paradise slowly opening like a flower
across the clouds and thunder of tumultuous
war, so he felt when, to the deep dismay of his
family, he went up to Dunlop and offered him
his sword. Numbers followed his example, but
of the brilliant and successful campaign in which
they took part there is no need to write here.
It has its place in history.</p>

<p>Twice the seasoned old soldier rode out with
the gallant little corps, called the <i>Khakee
Ressalah</i>, on account of its dust-coloured uniform,
and twice he returned to his trembling
wife and children, safe, but triumphant. As for
Trixy, though no less anxious than her sisters,
she did not once bid her father stay. I rather
think she would have liked to march with them.
'One of us ought to have been a boy,' she said
to her mother one day. 'Women have far the
worst of it&mdash;sitting at home and watching and weeping&mdash;it
is very hard work and rather humiliating.'</p>

<p>'Hush! Trixy; you don't know what you are
saying,' said Lady Elton. And then the wild
look that they all dreaded to see came over her
face, and she cried out piteously, 'Yes, child, you
are right. I have too many daughters, and the
world is cruel to women. If a man dies, he
dies fighting. If a woman dies&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Darling, you must not,' broke in Trixy
vehemently. 'I am a little idiot. Forgive me!
And do you know&mdash;listen, dearest, and don't
look so&mdash;do you know that I have been having
the strangest dreams about our Grace? When
she comes back&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'When, oh! Trixy, when&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Listen, dear, hear me to the end! When
she comes back, I believe we shall find that
she has the spirit of a heroine, if not of a hero.'</p>

<p>It was curious that this conversation, in
which, for the first time for many days, Grace's
name was mentioned before her mother, preceded
by only a few hours the arrival of the
letter from Lucy. It brought a slender ray of
comfort to Lady Elton, and now her one idea
was to reach Gumilcund herself. She dared not
speak of it to anyone; but, all the more for her
silence, it haunted her mind day and night. If
she could only go! If she could only go! Now
that her husband was well and she could feel
that Meerut was a safe refuge for the girls, the
spirit of passionate restlessness, which had once
nearly shaken her reason, took possession of her
with increased violence.</p>

<p>Sometimes it was like a madness. She would
watch her girls and the servants furtively, and
plan how she could evade them and slip away
silently. One evening she got up in her sleep
and reached as far as the door; but Yaseen
Khan, the faithful bearer, was stretched across
the threshold, and the noise he made, when she
tried to step over him, awoke her and aroused
the tent. After that they took fright and
watched her more closely.</p>

<p>When her reason was nearly giving way
under the strain, and she had begun to beg
piteously, not knowing what she said, to be taken
to Gumilcund, where it was now her possessing
idea that Grace was kept in prison, a strange
thing happened. A messenger from Gumilcund
found his way into Meerut. Trixy saw him come
in, and she recognised in him, as she believed,
the faquir who had brought the first letter from
Tom, and under whose convoy Bertie Liston had
left the station. Supposing his message to be
addressed to the General in command, she ran
back to their tent with the information. She
had scarcely time to give her news before Yaseen
Khan rushed in, crying out, 'A letter! a letter!
Missy Sahib is safe.'</p>

<p>The General was in his tent, furbishing up
his arms, which had seen hard service lately.
'Silence, you foolish fellow,' he cried out, 'do
you wish to kill the Mem Sahib? Give the letter
to me.'</p>

<p>'No, no; to me,' cried a piercing voice from
the further side of the tent. 'Children, let me
alone! I shall not faint. And, General, don't
you call the poor fellow names! What did
you say, Yaseen Khan? Safe? Say it again!
Safe! Safe!' She had rushed forward to meet
him. The letter was in her hand, but her fingers
trembled so that she could not open it. 'I am
afraid,' she said, looking round, with a pathetic
smile, 'that I shall have to ask some one to help
me after all. My hands have no power to-day.
No, General, not you. Trixy, come here! Open
it, but don't take it out of my hands!'</p>

<p>Trixy obeyed, the tears rolling down her
face. 'Why, your fingers are trembling too,'
said Lady Elton. 'Thank you, dear. Now read
it for me. My eyes are dim.' Trixy passed her
eyes over the paper and broke into a joyful cry.
'Well! well!' said her mother impatiently.
'Read it, every word!'</p>

<blockquote><p>'My dear Lady Elton,' began the girl, her
voice shaking, 'I am sending my faithful Subdul
to tell you and the General that we have found
your Grace. She has been ill, but she is better.
I am taking her to Gumilcund, where her cousin
and several other English ladies, whom I and
my men have been so happy as to rescue from
positions of peril, are living. We are accompanied
by an escort of Ghoorka soldiers. The
Captain, Gambier Singh, has most generously
put them at my disposal. I would willingly
come down to Meerut, but I fear to add to the
fatigues and hardships which your heroic child
has already undergone, and I may not keep the
escort longer than is absolutely necessary. I
detach Subdul, who is a skilful traveller, and
I believe that he will reach Meerut before we
reach Gumilcund. If it could possibly be arranged
for Lady Elton to join us there, I think it
would be well. Grace will be happier and more
at rest when she has seen one of her own people.
But, in a very short time, I hope and believe,
the country will settle down again, and then we
shall be able to meet. In the meantime, with
love and best remembrances,</p>

<p>'I remain, my dear Lady Elton,</p>

<p>'Your attached and always devoted friend,</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Thomas Gregory</span>.'</p></blockquote>

<p>So Trixy read. When her voice dropped
there was, for a few moments, silence in the
tent. Then a great babble began. The girls
clustered round their father. 'Oh! couldn't
you take us to Gumilcund?' they cried. 'Do,
Dad! Surely it could be managed.' Lady
Elton's voice only was missing. When the
General, setting his girls aside, looked round for
her, he saw that she was busy, with the help of
Yaseen Khan, putting a few necessaries together
for her travelling bag. 'You see, Wilfrid,' she
said, answering his look, 'I must go. My child
wants me.'</p>

<p>'We all want you, Grace.'</p>

<p>'Ah! but she wants me most. You will
arrange for me to go, will you not? Where is
this good Subdul? I might put on some sort of
disguise, as Bertie did.'</p>

<p>'Nonsense, my dear,' said the General
hoarsely. 'If anyone goes, I will.'</p>

<p>'No, Wilfrid. Your place is here. These
other children want looking after. No; no;
no,' as they crowded round her. 'I cannot
take you. You are safe at Meerut. And Grace
is safe! Oh! yes, Grace is safe; but she wants
me. Tom would not have written so if she did
not. And I, oh! my dear,' turning to her husband;
'forgive me if I am adding to your
trouble; but I cannot help it. I shall go mad
if you do not let me go.'</p>

<p>'Gently, Grace, gently!' said the General
brokenly.</p>

<p>'Say yes, and I will be as gentle as you
please,' she answered.</p>

<p>He stood for a few moments looking down at
her earnestly. Then he said, 'Promise me to
do nothing rash, and I will see what can be
done.'</p>

<p>'Thank you, dear,' she said humbly. 'Yes,
I will promise. But you must make haste.'</p>

<h4>HOW GUMILCUND RECEIVED HER PRINCE</h4>


<p>The month of October was in, and the great
heats of the plains were over. Events had been
marching. At Agra, which was still in a state
of siege, the large European population gathered
together in the fort and palace of the magnificent
Shah Jehan began to breathe more freely.
In Lucknow, where Sir Colin Campbell and his
veterans had not yet arrived, Havelock and
the gallant Outram held their own, and the
flagging spirits of the Europeans had been
cheered by several brilliant successes. Cawnpore
was in the hands of the English; but
Tantia Topee, the last general of note amongst
the mutineers, was gathering his forces together
for a final effort; and Jhansi, the home and
citadel of a woman scorned, bade proud defiance
to the English conquerors. These were the
news which met the Rajah of Gumilcund when,
journeying warily, he drew near to the gates of
his own city.</p>

<p>Things had been going well with him since
he parted from Gambier Singh. The country
was much quieter than he had expected; the
villages received them well; they had no
difficulty about supplies; their force was large
enough to frighten away the hordes of robbers
that haunted the highways; and Hoosanee, who
was their guide, took very good care that there
should be no chance encounters with mutineers.</p>

<p>The rest and good food, with the comparative
coolness of the atmosphere, had completely
restored little Kit. The colour came back into
his cheeks, and the sparkle into his eyes. It
was a delight to see him going about the camp
speaking in his little lordly way to the coolies
and servants, and picking up phrases of Nepaulese
with which to make friends with the
Ghoorka soldiers. There was not a soul in the
camp who did not adore him.</p>

<p>In one of the villages they had bought a
little hill pony for the child, and day after day
he trotted gravely by Tom's side, looking as
picturesque as a prince of fairyland, with his
brightly-coloured Indian garments, his blue and
white muslin turban, and his flowing golden
curls.</p>

<p>Grace, too, was better; but she did not
speak much, and Tom would not urge her. He
believed in the power of healing nature. In the
meantime he had despatched Subdul with the
letter, of whose arrival we have heard.</p>

<p>So, as I have said, they came on to Gumilcund.
The rajah had sent on swift runners to
apprise the people of his coming, and all the
city was in a ferment. It was afternoon when he
crossed the boundaries of the State. Most of the
peasantry had gone up to the town, so the country
had a somewhat deserted appearance; but it
gave him pleasure to see that the forts stationed
here and there for their protection were occupied
strongly, and that there had been no break in
the agricultural operations. The people went
about their usual work in the daytime, and
took refuge in the city at night.</p>

<p>He halted, as he had done before, just as
dusk began to fall, about a mile from the
principal gate of the city. Chunder Singh and
Lutfullah, with several other distinguished
citizens, and a gorgeously-attired retinue of
Indian cavalry, were drawn up here to do him
honour, and escort him to the city in state.</p>

<p>Bidding his Ghoorkas halt, Tom rode in
amongst them. He had scarcely done so before
he caught sight of his beautiful little Arab mare
Snow-queen. She had been ridden by no one
since the night when he rode her out to meet
the English fugitives, and, finding that two were
missing, went to Dost Ali Khan's fort to find
them. Now, hearing his voice, she whinnied,
and pawed the ground impatiently. In a
moment Tom had dismounted from the horse
he was riding, and vaulted on to her back. He
had much ado then to keep her quiet, but he
succeeded at last, after which he turned to
Chunder Singh. 'Thank you,' he said, holding
out his hand. 'This is a pledge to me of your
forgiveness.'</p>

<p>'There is no question of forgiveness, Rajah
Sahib,' said the grave Indian. 'I could have
wished for the sake of the people, who were
clamorous for tidings when they heard the
rajah had gone, that his Excellency had treated
me with more confidence. But is not that
amongst the things that have passed? We have
escaped from the fiery trial. The people of
Gumilcund and his Excellency, their rajah&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'The people will receive me, then?'</p>

<p>'The loyalty of the people of Gumilcund
to Byrajee Pirtha Raj, their ruler, has never
wavered.'</p>

<p>'That is well,' said Tom gravely. 'But you
must understand, Chunder Singh, and you, Lutfullah;
on some points I have changed since
last I dwelt amongst you. In the wilderness
where, for many days, I have been wandering
seeking for my kindred, I have come to this
determination chiefly,' he spoke in their own
language, which all of them could understand.
'I will not,' he went on, 'go amongst you any
more upon false pretences. I am an Englishman.
How and to what degree I am related to
your former rulers, or whether the mysterious tie
which seems to unite us is merely spiritual, I do
not know myself. I have written for information,
and as soon as I receive it I will pass it on
to you. In the meantime, I have determined to
go amongst you without disguise. Such as I
am, you and your people must receive me, and
if the idea of serving a foreign ruler is repugnant
to you I will retire and allow you to choose
your own ruler, on whose behalf I will promise
to interest myself with the British Government.
But, however this may be, I know'&mdash;he smiled,
and Chunder Singh, who had been listening with
a falling countenance, plucked up heart&mdash;'I
know,' he repeated, laying his hand on the closed
litter, which had been brought to the spot
where he had reined up Snow-queen, 'that for
the sake of those who have gone before me&mdash;ay,
and because they love the English name,
which has been a tower of strength to their city,
the good and loyal citizens of Gumilcund will
receive me with respect and affection and will
shelter and nourish the fugitives whom I have
brought with me until they can return in peace
to their own people.'</p>

<p>He paused, and a buzz of applause, not loud,
for these were grave citizens and Asiatics, but
deep and heartfelt, followed his words. 'Our
rajah has spoken well. Hah! Hah! He has
spoken words of wisdom. He has proved himself
the true son of Byrajee Pirtha Raj. Let
him come amongst us freely. The people are
waiting to receive him with honour.' So from
mouth to mouth the joyful answers ran.</p>

<p>Up to this everything was quiet, decorous,
and stately; Tom playing the part of an
Oriental potentate to perfection; the citizens
of Gumilcund reverential in manner and dignified
in speech and bearing; the two guards&mdash;the
Ghoorka escort on the one hand, and
the gorgeously caparisoned cavalry from Gumilcund
on the other&mdash;sitting their horses like
bronze images on either side of the space of
ground where the rajah and the chief men of
the city had met. And so it might have continued
but for that upsetting element, subversive
of all dignity, an English boy.</p>

<p>Kit had been riding in the rear of the cavalcade
with Bâl Narîn. He had seen one or two
things that interested him&mdash;a score or so of flying
foxes, hanging like black bags from the
trees, which he insisted upon disturbing, so that
he might see them fly&mdash;a huge cobra, which
they followed and killed, and a herd of screaming
jackals that he galloped after until Bâl
Narîn caught his pony by the rein and made
him come back. They were thus considerably
in the rear when the cavalcade halted.</p>

<p>Now, as soon as Kit saw that something was
going on, he set spurs to his pony, gained upon
the Ghoorka guard, passed it like a flash of
lightning at imminent risk of setting the whole
of it in motion, and drew rein by Tom's side just
as the citizens of Gumilcund were assuring him
of the continued homage of their city.</p>

<p>For a moment the child paused, looking out
at them. It was light enough to see him well&mdash;the
slender, shapely figure, the proud little head,
the shower of golden curls. Every one of the
grave men smiled. He answered their kind
looks with a ringing laugh. 'Are you the
people from Gumilcund?' he cried out, his
childish treble ringing shrill and clear through
the still air of the evening. 'And have you come
to meet us?'</p>

<p>'Hah! Hah!' answered the grave elders.
'Gumilcund people, little Sahib,'</p>

<p>'Oh! I say,' whispered Kit, in his own
tongue to Tom. '<i>Don't</i> they look jolly? Let's
give them an English cheer. Where are Bâl
Narîn and Hoosanee and the others? I've been
teaching them. They can cheer pretty well.
Come up, you men! Now then,' lifting his small
turban from his head, and holding it in one
hand, while he shook his reins with the other.
'Hip! Hip! Don't be frightened, you men!
Sing out! Hip! Hip! Hooray! That's better!
Again! Hip, Hip, Hooray! for Gumilcund.
And for the rajah&mdash;a good one this time!'</p>

<p>The men had begun to cheer with might and
main&mdash;the soldiers joined. It was a joyful tumult,
the like of which had never been heard in Gumilcund
before. The grave citizens were bewildered.
The horses, unaccustomed to the noise, grew
restive. It was all Tom could do to hold Snow-queen
in. 'That's enough, Kit,' he cried. '<i>Bus!
Bus,</i> we shall be at the gates in another moment,
if you go on like this!'</p>

<p>'All right!' said Kit, 'I'll be as mum as a
mouse directly. Just one more, Hip! Hip!
Hooray! for Grace Sahib. Three times three!
and three times more for luck!' And thereupon,
the mischievous little urchin threw up his turban,
caught it in his right hand, and rattled his
reins over the pony's neck. Off it started at a
hand-gallop; Snow-queen, who had been chafing
under her master's detaining hand, went off in
pursuit; the grave men of Gumilcund mounted
their carriages as speedily as they could, and
the two escorts found their horses unmanageable.
For the level mile that lay between them
and Gumilcund, it was a stampede, rather than
a trot. But Kit, on his fiery mountain pony,
headed them the whole way.</p>

<p>At the bridge which spans the ravine between
the walls of the city and the open
country, he drew the pony up and looked
round. Tom and Snow-queen were close behind
him. 'Isn't it a lark?' he cried out.
'Teazer would go, you know; I couldn't help
him.'</p>

<p>'How much did you try, you young
monkey?' said Tom. 'But since you are still,
keep still for a few moments! We must let these
good gentlemen come up. And Grace&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I say&mdash;what wonderful chaps those bearers
are!' cried the irrepressible child. 'They've
been running with her. She'll be inside almost
as soon as we shall. Good-bye, Tom. I must
trot back and get her to open the palki. She
looks lovely, I know, and they'd all like to see
her.'</p>

<p>Back he went, shouting out greetings to his
Ghoorka friends. The two escorts, in the meantime,
had fallen into double lines on the bridge.
The elders of Gumilcund descended from their
carriages and formed themselves into a procession.
Tom, on Snow-queen, stood in front of
them. Their faces were turned away from
Gumilcund and towards the road by which they
had come in. The palki and its eight bearers
came on at a rapid run. The curtains were
open. Grace had given in to the request of
Kit, which he had been artful enough to represent
as coming from Tom. And truly she was
glad to see the light of this wonderful evening;
for her heart was beating with a host of new
feelings, and she had much trouble to keep
herself quiet. Nearer and nearer drew the open
palki. The light of the heavens had departed;
but, as if by magic, a host of fairy lamps had
sprung into being. They ran along the parapets
of the bridge, up and down, throwing a weird
radiance on the dark faces and showy accoutrements
of the Ghoorka and Gumilcund soldiers.
From the causeway, which led from the bridge
to the gates of the city, thrown hospitably open,
they shone out in myriads. Held on long poles
they came flashing along&mdash;a glittering line of
light. At the bridge the line divides, and while
some of the light-carriers group themselves
round the procession of citizens and their rajah,
others run on to meet the palki. They form
round it, and the light of their flaming torches
falls full on the pale face, the snowy raiment,
the golden hair, and deep steadfast eyes of the
English girl.</p>

<p>Wonderingly the people gaze upon her, for
they think that they see a vision. As for the
rajah, his heart gives a great bound. Even he,
who knows her so well, has never seen her look
so lovely. But what is the meaning of that
strangeness in her face; the fixed gaze; the
aloofness? To him she is like one who is
moving in two worlds, whose body is present,
and whose spirit is far away.</p>

<p>The palki stops. It is uplifted still on the
shoulders of the bearers, so that all who are
within the radius of the torchlight can see it
plainly. Tom had meant himself to step forward
and bid her welcome, but he cannot speak
for the rush of tears that are blinding and
choking him. He bends himself low over his
saddle-bow in the graceful Oriental fashion, and
makes a signal to Chunder Singh, who steps
forward.</p>

<p>'Madam,' he says, in excellent English, 'his
Excellency permits me the honour of being the
first to welcome you to Gumilcund. My friends
and I have heard your story, and know what
your sufferings and your heroism have been.
Accept our assurances that your troubles are
over. In the rajah's city the gracious lady will
be as safe as in her own country and amongst
those who have served her from her childhood.'</p>

<p>'I am sure of it, Chunder Sahib,' says Grace,
bowing and smiling, 'and I thank you from my
heart.'</p>

<p>That is all she can say, for the irrepressible
little Kit has drowned her voice in another wild
cheer, and from the bridge, and the causeway
leading up to the gates, and from within the
gates whence the light of a myriad lamps and
the tumult of a great multitude gathered
together is pouring, the shout comes back in
deep waves of sound that rise and fall on the
still air like joyful music.</p>

<p>Then the rajah gives the word, and the palki
with its bearers, and the merry company of light
carriers advance, Snow-queen, who has been
reduced to order, stepping proudly in front of
them, while the elders of Gumilcund, some of
whom are 'fat and scant of breath,' mount their
carriages and bring up the rear.</p>

<p>Then what a joyful tumult of welcome! All
through the great avenue, with its double rows
of trees, it is one sea of turbaned heads and
waving garments and banners carried proudly
aloft. Here and there the procession has barely
room to pass, but the good temper of everyone
in the crowd is perfect, and whenever the rajah,
who takes the lead, draws rein, the multitudes
separate of their own accord, and leave them a
living lane to pass through.</p>

<p>So, moving slowly, they come on to the
market-place.</p>

<p>Vishnugupta, the priest, is waiting for them
here. It is an encounter which Tom would fain
have delayed until a quieter moment, for the
Brahmin devotee, who had doubtless believed
in his pure caste and high lineage, may not, he
thinks, be so ready to receive him as the simple
citizens. But he is mistaken. To Vishnugupta,
in his sacerdotal capacity, Byrajee Pirtha Raj
was no less of an alien than his successor. But,
like many another priest both of the East and
of the West, he was something more than a
person of approved sanctity. He was a patriot
and a citizen. He knew what the present
regimen had done for Gumilcund, where he had
lived before the days of Byrajee Pirtha Raj and
his father, and he recognised the advantages the
whole country derived from the overlordship
of the British. It was in the speech that Tom
had made to the people, when rumours of
mutiny were first rife in the country, that he
had conquered Vishnugupta, the Brahmin
devotee and astute politician. That he was of a
different country and religion went for nothing
with the priest. Nor, strange as it may seem,
and although he belonged professedly to one of
the most mystical faiths the world has ever
known, did the legend current amongst the
people of their late so passionately loved ruler
having returned to them in the form of this
young and comely stranger, affect him in the
least. It might be so and it might not.
Vishnugupta would not express an opinion.
What he did feel and say was that the rule of
the stranger was good for the city.</p>

<p>And so, to the surprise of Tom and to the
measureless delight of the people who thronged
round him, Vishnugupta received him with
honour such as he had not granted even to his
predecessors. Standing head and shoulders
above the crowd, his hands, in one of which he
held a cage of living brands, uplifted, and his
white hair streaming in the wind, he called upon
the procession to halt while, in a flood of words,
all the more impressive to those who stood
by for its mystical strangeness, he called down
blessings upon the chosen of the gods.</p>

<p>He ceased, and making a low obeisance, the
rajah passed on silently. Behind him were the
golden-haired child and the English girl in her
open palki. Vishnugupta stood in front of it,
and the bearers stopped. So piercing was his
gaze that even Kit was silenced. But Grace
looked back at him calmly.</p>

<p>For the space of an instant they looked at
one another across the shadows, and then the
girl's lips parted in a slow and sorrowful smile.
'We will speak together another time,' she said
quietly in English. 'You are a good man. I
could trust you.'</p>

<p>'So be it,' said Vishnugupta, bending his
proud head. He stood aside, and the procession,
which was on its way to the palace, swept by
him.</p>

<p>He had meant to follow, but he stood like
one abashed, and his hands dropped, and the
cage of fire which he had been lifting over the
heads of the people, swung idly by his side, and
those who had flocked round him, fearing accident,
fell away, so that in a few moments he
stood alone. Plunged deeply in thought, he did
not observe the absence of bystanders. One,
however, fascinated by his strange appearance,
lingered and heard him whisper: 'That look!
And on the face of a woman! I would fain see
it again. But I fear! I fear! Ram! Ram!
My heart flows from me like rivers that seek the
sea.'</p>

<p>For a few moments his head sank on his
breast. Then he raised it, and the fascinated
observer watched him move forward slowly, till
he reached the palace gate, which had closed
behind the rajah and his party, but which, as he
knew, would have opened at a word from him.
There, for an instant, he paused in indecision.
His hand touched the bell, but he withdrew it.
'Though I am a Guru and twice-born,' he murmured,
'I am old, and my eyes have not the
precision of youth. To-night I will not see
her again.'</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h5><a name="CHAPTER_XLVII" id="CHAPTER_XLVII">CHAPTER XLVII</a></h5>

<h4>IN THE PALACE</h4>


<p>In the general excitement no one had remembered
to tell the English ladies of the missive
that had been received from the rajah. Through
Sumbaten, however, who loved gossip as much
as those of her order at home, some rumour of
what was going on had filtered into their quarters
of the palace. Lingering in one of the
outer halls, and wondering at the stir in the
house, she was told that the rajah's apartments
were being made ready for him, and that he was
coming home that night.</p>

<p>Armed with this joyful news she ran back to
her ladies. This was early in the afternoon.
They did not believe her in the least, so they said;
yet, as the time went on, they too became aware
that something unusual was going forward. At the
instance of Sumbaten, reinforced by Lucy, they
put on gala attire. Then they wandered up and
down the shaded alley that led from the inner
marble court to the summer-house, longing for
this day of many hours to come to an end.</p>

<p>When at last the dusk began to fall, Sumbaten,
who had been sent into the outer court to
watch, came running in to say that there was
an extraordinary stir in the market-place; but
that she could get no one to tell her what it
meant, for all the palace was empty.</p>

<p>Then they gathered together and looked into
one another's faces with wonder and hope and
terror. Mrs. Lyster was as pale as death. Mrs.
Durant, who could not stand, clutched at her
arm. Little Dick's mother seized her child, who
was playing about on the grass, and clasped him
in her arms, whispering that perhaps it was
a rising and couldn't they get away or hide?
Lucy was trembling too, but she would show no
lack of courage. 'Nonsense,' she said a little
scornfully. She looked down and saw Aglaia
standing close beside her, her clear eyes shining
like globes of light and her cheeks as red as a
newly opened rose. 'What do you think, little
Miss Wisdom?' she said.</p>

<p>'I'm not wise, I'm foolish,' said Aglaia, 'but
I know he is coming, and the people are making
a noise because they are glad. Hadn't we better
go into the hall to meet them?'</p>

<p>'Yes; yes; come along! Aglaia has more
sense than all of us put together,' said Lucy.</p>

<p>'Oh! but is all right? How shall I bear
it? How shall I bear it?' cried Mrs. Durant.</p>

<p>'It will soon be over. Have courage for a
few more moments! Ah! if I had only your
hope!' said Mrs. Lyster.</p>

<p>'I beg your pardon, dear,' murmured Mrs.
Durant. 'I had forgotten.'</p>

<p>They went together into the hall, where they
found everything in readiness for them. Beautifully-shaded
lamps, which diffused a warm glow
over the apartment, were lighted; the water in
the fountain in the midst of the hall, and in the
channels that ran through it, was stirring briskly;
and on the daïs at the upper end, which was
decorated with Persian rugs and embroidered
curtains from famous Indian looms, their usual
evening meal was spread out. With its
delicately-wrought pavement, its sculptured
pillars, its flowers and ferns and gaily-plumaged
birds, it was a room to make the mouth of the
modern æsthete water. But the English ladies
were accustomed to its beauty, and to-night they
had no thoughts for it. They were given up to
listening, to watching for that which was to
come. Moments passed into minutes, and never
surely were minutes so tardy in their flight.
Louder, meanwhile, and louder grew the tumult
below. Lucy threatened to veil herself and run
outside, but the others held her back. Sumbaten
would rush out, stay away a few moments, and
come back with a sensational piece of news.
They listened with white faces, all but Aglaia,
whose eyes were dancing, and whose face was
bright with colour.</p>

<p>At last, when their patience was nearly at an
end, they heard the gates of the palace open.
Then the sound of many voices came floating
through the courts and passages and staircases
that separated their apartments from the outer
enclosure, and Sumbaten came rushing in to cry
out that the rajah had come in.</p>

<p>And now little Lucy set her teeth together,
and Mrs. Durant gave a low moan. 'Look out,'
she whispered to Mrs. Lyster. 'I dare not.'
But in the next instant she was flying across the
hall, with a wild cry of joy, 'Kit! Kit! I hear
him!'</p>

<p>She had heard him&mdash;the little silver voice that
she had thought never upon earth to hear again
had rung out clearly above all those others. 'Kit!
Kit!' It was all over then&mdash;the anguish, the
suspense, the horror of great darkness. Kit,
her own golden-haired Kit, was safe. But
another cry, a cry shrill and joyous, echoes
through the palace court. He is in front, of
course&mdash;the enterprising little hero; all these
people are so slow and so stately that he cannot
wait for them. He has penetrated to the foot of
the great staircase that leads up to the ladies'
court and hall. There he catches a glimpse of
his mother's pale face irradiated with joy.
'Mother!' he cries.</p>

<p>'Kit, my little Kit, my darling!' She has him
in her arms. She is kissing him, fondling him,
breathing sweet nothings over him as if he were
a baby. It is all very pleasant, of course, but to
a hero of Kit's standing just a little humiliating.</p>

<p>'Thank you, mother dear,' he says. 'I'm
awfully glad too! But look here!' drawing
himself gently away. 'Couldn't you kiss me
presently? I don't mind it, you know. I like
it. But there are such a lot of people here just
now, and we're blocking up the way.' Put
down upon his feet, he smoothed his ruffled
plumes, and looked round him with dignity.
'Ah!' seeing Lucy close by, 'here's some one
else I know. How do you do, Lucy?'</p>

<p>'Very well, thank you, Kit,' said Lucy, with
corresponding gravity.</p>

<p>'You look all right,' said Kit. 'I've
brought back Grace, you know. But I say,'
catching sight of Aglaia, 'who's this?'</p>

<p>'Do you want to be introduced to her
formally, you ridiculous child?' said Lucy.
'Mrs. Durant, for heaven's sake take him away!
He will make me laugh, and I feel more inclined
to cry. Ah! Here they come! Grace!
Grace!'</p>

<p>'Daddy Tom!' said Aglaia, pressing forward.</p>

<p>'Tom! Tom Gregory! How could I ever have
mistaken him?' cried Mrs. Lyster; but she kept
in the background, and her cheeks, which had
been so pale, were flushed with colour. They
were mounting the marble steps together, Grace
leaning on the rajah's arm, and he with no eyes
for anyone but her. She was very pale, as if
she were weary, and there was a curious steadfast
look in her eyes, which rested nowhere; but
seemed always to be looking on to something
beyond.</p>

<p>'Grace!' repeated Lucy, and could say no
more, for the words seemed frozen on her lips.
Then, in a rapid whisper to Tom, 'Does she
know us? Why does she look so?'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes. She is tired. I am afraid the
coming in and the welcome of the people have
been too much for her,' said Tom hoarsely. 'Let
her rest, and she will be better to-morrow!'</p>

<p>He did not ask for Mrs. Lyster, who kept
still in the background watching him with one
of her old smiles upon her lips. To Mrs.
Durant, who had caught his hands and was
pouring out her gratitude, he could scarcely pay
even the attention necessary for politeness. As
for Aglaia, her whispered greeting had been
quite unheeded. He had not so much as seen
her. The child turned away with a pale face
and clouded eyes. 'He saved me too,' she
whispered; 'but he has forgotten.'</p>

<p>They had reached the top of the stairs.
Grace was smiling, but there was still that
strange fixed look in her eyes. Lucy, divided
between tears and laughter, threw her arms
about her cousin's neck, and covered her face
with kisses. Then she led her in to the others,
chattering wildly. 'I can scarcely believe you
have really come back!' she cried. 'I think I
shall awake to-morrow and find it a dream. If
you only knew what I have gone through,
darling. I felt myself such a dreadful coward.
I should have gone away with you as Kit did,
brave little Kit! And oh! aren't you glad to
be amongst us again? To-morrow you must
tell us your adventures. Grace! why do you
look so? Laugh! cry! say you are happy
or sorry! Do anything! Perhaps it would
be a relief to your feelings to scream. I
know it would be to mine,' said Lucy, gazing
at her cousin earnestly. But Grace only smiled
that placid smile, looking out still as if she
saw something beyond them. They brought
her to a softly-cushioned divan on the daïs.
Tom had given her up to Lucy. He was
stumbling back across the hall when his glance
fell upon Aglaia, and he stopped. She was
standing by herself, and her eyes were full of
tears.</p>

<p>'Aglaia!' he said, stooping over her kindly.
'Are you crying because we have come back?'</p>

<p>The child did not speak. 'But what is it,
then? I thought I should have seen you
dancing with joy.'</p>

<p>'I was a few minutes ago,' said Aglaia
vaguely.</p>

<p>'And has something happened since then,
little friend? Come! Tell me! They are all
busy up there, so no one else will hear.'</p>

<p>'No; no; no; it's nothing,' said Aglaia,
choking back her sobs. 'I <i>am</i> your little friend
still.'</p>

<p>'Of course you are, dear. Did you think I
was so fickle as to have forgotten you?'</p>

<p>The pink flush mounted to Aglaia's face.</p>

<p>'Please forgive me,' she said softly. 'And'&mdash;hesitating&mdash;</p>

<p>'Yes, dear&mdash;go on!'</p>

<p>'She is lovely. I think I shall love her,
even though you do like her best.'</p>

<p>'Best!' echoed Tom, smiling. 'Now you are
a little goose! Don't you know, Aglaia, that
there are different kinds of loving! I love you
as my child&mdash;my little friend.'</p>

<p>'And Grace?' said Aglaia. 'Isn't she your
friend too?'</p>

<p>'She is my friend, and something more. At
least, I hope so. You know we may have more
friends than one.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Aglaia doubtfully. But she
added under her breath, 'There is only one
best.'</p>

<h4>A LETTER FROM ENGLAND</h4>


<p>Leaving Grace to come to herself in the hands of
her friends, we will follow the young rajah to his
rooms, where several people were waiting to have
audience of him. He despatched the business
which they brought to him with his usual clear-sightedness
and rapidity, received the congratulations
of the Resident, who had come up to see
him, and of the two young officers whom he had
so happily rescued, appointed a session for the
following day, in open court, to try the cases,
and read the petitions which had been accumulating
during his absence, promised to attend
later a supper which the Resident had prepared
in his honour, and then, being left at last to the
ministrations of Hoosanee and Ganesh, he turned
to the letters and papers heaped high upon his
table. Before turning them over he stopped to
think. Up to this he had been too busy to reflect.
All day long, ever since he touched the
boundaries of the State, a vague sense of wonder
had been present in his mind. He was trying
now to puzzle it out. When, two months ago,
he left Gumilcund secretly, when he camped out
in the forest waiting for news from Dost Ali
Khan, he had felt like an escaped prisoner. Now,
having fulfilled his mission, and returned to the
bondage which he had remembered as so galling,
he found, to his surprise, that it was bondage no
longer. He had left Gumilcund as a prison; he
returned to it as a home. And it was not that
he had lost his love for England. On the contrary,
he had never loved England more: he had
never felt prouder of his connection with her.
Some day, if his life was spared, he hoped to
revisit his early home, and to see his mother and
the friends of his youth. But he belonged to
India, not to England. A few weeks ago, it
would have given him keen pain to say this even
to himself. It would have been a renunciation
such as he could scarcely have had strength to
face. Now he did not find that any effort was
needed. The wonder to him was that he had
not recognised it before.</p>

<p>Hoosanee and Ganesh were chattering busily,
as they made preparations for his toilet and his
tea. Their voices came to him like the distant
buzzing of bees; but the sounds warned him that
he must not give much more time to thought.
He was turning over the papers mechanically.
They were spread out on a beautiful table of
marble inlaid with precious stones. Above it
swung a gold lamp of delicate workmanship.
He wondered a little at the familiarity of these
things, at the sense of coming back to his own&mdash;he
who had only enjoyed them for so short a
time! The papers did not seem to be of the
first importance. There were belated news-sheets&mdash;circulars&mdash;petitions;
answers sent to
inquiries of his own by Indian civil and military
officers, some of which he put by for more careful
perusal on the following day, and two or
three letters from private friends. He was about
to turn away from his hasty inspection, and to
give himself over into the hands of Hoosanee,
when at the very bottom of the pile, a bulky
letter, different in appearance from any of the
others, drew his notice. As he took it up his
heart began to beat strangely. He held it up to
the light. It was addressed in his mother's handwriting&mdash;the
delicate, flowing penmanship he
knew so well; what made it so peculiarly
remarkable to him was not only its size and
weight; but that, for the first time since he took
up his position, his mother had addressed him by
his Indian name and title.</p>

<p>He looked at the date, went through a brief
calculation, and then sank down upon his seat,
feeling, for the moment, sick and faint. The
letter was an answer to that written at Lucknow,
in which he had begged so earnestly to be told
his true position. Trembling from head to foot,
he put it within his vest. How he passed
through that evening with all its formalities&mdash;how,
carrying about with him the consciousness
of this letter which he had not yet dared to open,
he talked and laughed and jested, and told the
tale of his adventures, and independently of <i>it&mdash;it</i>,
that might change his whole life&mdash;entered into
engagements and appointments, and made plans
for the future&mdash;how, when the long evening of
festivities was over, he found strength to go
quietly to his room, and, dismissing Hoosanee,
to sit down under the swinging lamp and open
it, he never quite knew. But it was done at last,
and that was his last moment of weakness. The
four closely written sheets, in which his poor
mother told the secret that had made the joy
and the torment of her life, he read to the end
without wavering. When he got up from their
perusal, his face was perfectly pale, but his eyes
glistened strangely.</p>

<p>For a few moments he paced the room. He
went to the marble lattice, and, leaning his head
against it, let the soft and fragrant air blow in
upon his closed eyelids and burning forehead.
He looked back upon his room&mdash;the room where
Byrajee Pirtha Raj had breathed his last&mdash;the
sculptured pillars, the inlaid pavement, and the
fretted roof. He turned to the window again,
and looked out upon the solemn Indian night&mdash;the
still earth&mdash;the dark trees with their ink-black
shadows&mdash;the piercing radiance of silver
stars winning its way through the finely-wrought
marble. His mind was strangely upset. It was
as if a revolution, in the conduct of which his
own will had neither place nor power, were being
wrought within him. And for this moment, at
least, emotion was as passive as will. If he had
any feeling, it was a sense of satisfaction that
the mystery of the past was solved. He knew
now to whom he belonged&mdash;knew that it was
through no caprice of an eccentric stranger, but
by the will of the Divine, which, from the beginning,
had shaped his course for this end, that he
had been called to his present position. Whether
he was sorry or glad, uplifted or humiliated,
would be for to-morrow to determine. To-night
he had no more force left, even to feel.</p>

<p>And so he threw off his festive garments,
extinguished the lamps, stretched himself out on
the couch which for the first time since he had
occupied it seemed to belong to him; and Sleep,
the nursing-mother of wearied human souls, received
him presently into her keeping.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>While the rajah sleeps, I must tell very
briefly the story that his letter contained. To do
so, it will be necessary to go far back into the past.
Not only those early years which were so much
of a puzzle to Mrs. Gregory's friends, but the
years that preceded them, must be touched upon
if we wish to understand how she and her son
stood, and of what nature was the confession
which his passionate entreaties had drawn from
her. I have already said that she belonged to
an honourable and distinguished family, well-known
in early Anglo-Indian records. General
Sir Anthony Bracebridge, her grandfather, who
began as a subaltern in one of the Company's
regiments and worked his way up to a high command
and the honour of knighthood, went to
India in the days when home-leave was an almost
unknown privilege, and when English ladies had
not yet begun to make India a field for the display
of their talents and accomplishments. Yet upon
him, as upon others, came the season when a
'young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of
love.' He was more fortunate than most of his
comrades, in that, through a romantic adventure,
he won the favour of an Indian family of
power, wealth, and high lineage. It happened
that the daughter of a rajah, concerning whose
beauty and magnificence the wildest rumours
were afloat, was on her way to the sacred
bathing-ghat, where she was accustomed to offer
up her morning prayers, when her escort was
attacked by a body of men belonging to a neighbouring
rajah. This person had asked her hand
in marriage, and been refused. Burning with
fury at the insult offered to him, he had determined
to seize her by force. So he might have
done, for, after a fierce conflict, the escort of the
maiden was nearly overpowered; but, as fate
would have it, Captain Bracebridge and a few
English troopers were passing through the town.
These, as was natural, threw themselves into
the mêlée, the maiden was rescued, and the
Englishmen, being full of chivalrous ardour,
refused to leave her until they had seen her
safely within the gates of her father's palace.</p>

<p>That Captain Bracebridge should have won
for himself the everlasting gratitude of the
maiden's father for this gallant deed of arms was
not wonderful. But what did seem strange to
those who knew the manners of the times was
that he was presently adopted by the whole
household as a friend. After a decent interval,
during which he gained an influence, so extraordinary
as to be attributed by many of their
own people to magic, over the minds of the
rajah and his brothers, he married with her
father's consent, and according to English rites,
the beautiful girl whom he had so gallantly
defended from peril and outrage.</p>

<p>The marriage, so the story goes, proved perfectly
happy; but the bliss was of brief duration.
After little more than two years of wedlock,
Captain Bracebridge's Indian wife died, leaving a
son behind her. On this son the father poured
out the most devoted affection. He is said to
have been a rarely beautiful creature; but all
his affinities were with his mother's race. Notwithstanding
this, it was his father's wish to
bring him up as an English gentleman. I think
one of his favourite schemes was through this
boy, on whom a large fortune had been settled
by his Indian relatives, to re-establish the fortunes
of the Bracebridge family, and restore the
ancient glories of their ancestral seat. But it
was not to be. For although the boy was intellectually
gifted, drinking in learning and science
with an eagerness that surprised his teachers, he
was not the stuff of which the ordinary English
gentleman is made. He was too dreamy, too
sensitive and far too strange a being to make
any sort of a success in society. Recalled to
India, where General Bracebridge had, by this
time, made both money and renown, he found
that in the proud little official world, of which
he was expected to form a part, he was even
more of an alien than in England, and at last,
stung by slights, some of them fancied and some
of them real, he announced his determination of
giving up his English citizenship altogether, and
knitting himself to his mother's race and family.</p>

<p>It may almost be said that Gumilcund owed its
birth to this determination. The estate on which
that flourishing little city now stands was, about
this time, bequeathed to him by one of his grand-uncles,
and he was in the enjoyment of the vast
fortune settled upon him by his grandfather.
Part of this money he spent in building Gumilcund,
while the energy and political talent that
had found no scope amongst his father's people,
were devoted to the task of organising it.</p>

<p>General Bracebridge, in the meantime, indemnified
himself for his disappointment by entering
into a second marriage, which, the world
said, was far more satisfactory than the first.
In course of time a second son was born to him;
but he never lost his deep love for the first, and
as long as he lived, the Rajah of Gumilcund, who
had, in course of time, married and, in his turn,
become a father, was a frequent and welcome
visitor at his house.</p>

<p>There Mrs. Gregory, his grandchild, then a
lovely little girl six or seven years old, met her
Indian cousin, who was just verging upon manhood.
He was handsome, gracious, and noble,
and she loved him as little children love their
first hero. She was sent to England to school,
and returned, after ten long years of absence,
with her cousin's image fresh in her mind. Her
grandfather was dead then, and the intimacy
between the English and Indian branches of the
house of Bracebridge was not so close as it
had been. Nevertheless the cousins, who had
thought of one another kindly all these years,
met and loved.</p>

<p>Colonel Bracebridge was absent on a frontier
war. His wife was dead. The simple, inexperienced
English girl was left very much to
her own devices. After a ball, at which the
Indian rajah had been the stateliest figure, she
was persuaded to enter into a clandestine marriage.
But, though feeling had carried her
away for a time, her instincts of prudence and
propriety were too strong to be altogether
fought down, even by love. She left her husband,
who would fain have persuaded her to
give up all for him, and travelled under the
escort of faithful servants to the station where
her father was in command. To him she confessed
what she had done, entreating his consent
to celebrate publicly the marriage into which
she had entered in secret. A terrible scene followed,
for Colonel Bracebridge was of those who
considered the admixture of alien blood in a
family a disgrace and a sin. He told his daughter
harshly that her marriage was no marriage, and
threatened her with the loss not only of his protection,
but of the good word of every friend
she possessed, if she would not promise him
never to see her so-called husband again.</p>

<p>For many days she held out; but the strong
will and passionate, overbearing temper of her
father, reinforced by depressing tales from him
and others of how, if she persisted in her folly,
she would be shut up in a zenana, and as much
cut off from the world as a nun in a convent,
prevailed at last. She was only sixteen, too
young to take a line of her own, or to do battle
with those she was trained to obey; and, doubtless,
she was not capable then, nor ever would
have been, of that strong and perfect love which
holds firm and faithful through all the storms of
destiny and shocks of change. Moved by her
father, she wrote a letter to the rajah, reproaching
him for the advantage he had taken of her
inexperience, and a few weeks later she was prevailed
upon to marry Captain Gregory, having
first told him the whole story and assured him
that she could never love him. As a fact she
came to love him dearly, both on account of the
sacrifices he had made for her, and for his own
sake. As for her little son, whom in the vain
hope that he would be a Bracebridge and nothing
else, she called 'Tom,' he was born in wedlock,
and only a very few knew that he was not the
true son of Captain Gregory.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h5><a name="CHAPTER_XLIX" id="CHAPTER_XLIX">CHAPTER XLIX</a></h5>

<h4>SEEN IN THE LIGHT OF MORNING</h4>


<p>When the rajah awoke the following morning he
was conscious of a curious novelty, not only in
the world about him, but in his own relations
towards it. Deep down in his heart was a
tremulous feeling of anxiety and incertitude that
might presently become pain; but, for the
moment, and floating buoyantly on the surface
of his being, there was a sense of completeness
and satisfaction such as he had never known
before.</p>

<p>The first thought&mdash;rapturous as the saint's
vision of Paradise&mdash;which leapt to his heart was
that Grace was under his roof. His roof&mdash;he
repeated the words with a pleasant emphasis on
the pronoun, for it had brought him back to the
revelation of the previous night.</p>

<p><i>His</i>&mdash;yes, his&mdash;in a new sense. The State&mdash;the
city&mdash;the palace&mdash;the servants who had
attended upon him with such marvellous fidelity&mdash;the
councillors, by whom he had been inducted
into the duties of his position, and to
whose wisdom and disinterestedness he owed it
that he had been able to leave the task of
government, which had become irksome to him,
and to rescue and bring back in triumph the
English girl, so much dearer to him than life&mdash;all
these were his! His father&mdash;how warmly
his heart thrilled to the name!&mdash;the great man,
who up to this had been an enigma to him&mdash;a
mysterious and disturbing element in his life&mdash;had
given them to him: had prepared many of
them for him most likely, with a view to the
difficulties and dangers that he foresaw would
beset him. This was the entrancing thought
which glorified that strange awakening. The
sensation was as that of one who steps out of
a wilderness into a well-ordered home.</p>

<p>True the story was somewhat of a tangle to
him still. There had been a moment&mdash;an awful
moment&mdash;during its perusal when the blood had
rushed like fire to his brain, and he had held
back his breath in terror of what he might have
to know. But it had passed. Byrajee Pirtha
Raj was no stranger to him. Through his
works; through the strange yet always noble
inspirations that had surged to his soul when
he was, as he still firmly believed, holding commune
with him; through the impression of
himself he had left upon his friends and contemporaries,
all of whom looked upon him as
something more than a man, the young rajah
had learned to know his father; and his mother's
story, which, through all its penitence and self-accusation,
hinted dimly at a great wrong done
to her, did not stagger him, as it might otherwise
have done. Wrong there had been, and
grievous mistake and misconception; but he
was passionately convinced that his father had
meant no evil. To him the marriage-rite, whatever
it had been, through which he had knit the
fortunes of the woman he loved to his own, had
been true and holy and perfect.</p>

<p>So Tom said to himself, and it may be as
well to say here that his instincts were true.
His mother had not told, and, indeed, being
young then to the ways of the world, she did not
herself understand all the circumstances that had
led up to the step which she afterwards so
bitterly deplored. As a fact, partly through her
own folly and inexperience, and partly through
the mischievous devices of one of her friends,
she had been thrown, after that memorable ball,
into an extremely compromising situation, and it
was no less to shield her honour than to gratify
his own ardent love that her chivalrous cousin
had proposed the hasty marriage and carried it
through. He honestly believed then that her
father, when he came to know everything, would
give to their union joyfully the seal of his
approval.</p>

<p>He was, as we know, undeceived; and it
was to save her from the pain of a final breach
with her race and nation that he had bowed
silently to her decision to leave him. It was for
her sake that he had not disputed the validity
of her marriage with Captain Gregory. For her
sake&mdash;ah! was it for her sake, or was it for the
sake of Gumilcund, of India, of the high policy
which he so consistently and courageously pursued&mdash;that
he had allowed his son and successor
to grow up away from him and in a distant
land? This, with many another secret which
Tom would have given everything he possessed
to know, had died with the dead rajah. But his
son knew enough to give to his life a new spring
of gladness&mdash;a new soul of order. For now
the war of contending impulses that had
bewildered him was over. His present grew
naturally out of his past, and formed, in its turn,
a fitting prelude to the deeper harmonies of the
future.</p>

<p>It was very early. The dawn was just
breaking in the eastern heavens. Through the
pierced marble lattices came the golden light,
tracing, with its airy pencil, soft patterns of light
and shade on the roof and wall. The morning
air, burdened with delicate odours of tropical
lilies and Cape jessamine and heliotrope and late-flowering
roses, stole in rejoicingly. Then came
sounds of awakening in the palace. The chowkedars,
or night-watchmen, cried out to one
another, and gave up their posts to the bearers
and chuprassies. The royal peacock, perched on
the garden wall, shook out his jewelled fan to
the sun and screamed in discordant tones his
welcome to the morning. Innumerable doves, of
old time pensioners of the palace, swept past the
marble lattices, with a whirr and flutter of soft
grey wings, to take toll from the heaps of yellow
grain piled up in the outer court. The stir of
the city, the lowing of kine, the rumble of
wheels, the cries of those who bought and sold,
the ring of metal, wrought painfully into forms
of use and beauty, the monotonous beat of
hammers&mdash;these, with the thousand indistinguishable
sounds of a multitude in busy movement,
fell, softened by distance, on the young
rajah's ears. His heart swelled as he listened,
and his eyes were dim with a sudden rush of
tears. All the strangeness, all the wonder, all
the curious tangle of conflicting passions and
fates had brought him hither&mdash;he, in his weakness
and inexperience&mdash;to be the ruler of this
people. Yes; and the strangest part of it was
that he felt in himself a fitness for the work he
was called upon to do.</p>

<p>He remembered his boyish choice of a profession.
If he could not be amongst those who, by
their thought and genius, build up the destinies of
men and nations, he would, he said, build houses
for them to dwell in, and temples where they
could worship. He had entered upon the lower
task; suddenly and unexpectedly he had been
called to the higher. What did it mean? Had
he really the constructive power, of which, in his
boyish ignorance, he had boasted? And if so&mdash;ah!
if so&mdash;how was he to use it?</p>

<p>As these thoughts succeeded one another
through his mind, they took gradually a wider
range. Beyond his own narrow individuality,
beyond the little city and the busy crowd, they
wandered, till, as in a vision, he seemed to see
the truth at which as yet he had but dimly
guessed. He did not stand alone. He was one
in a chain. Purposes, strongly linked together,
had been passed on from hand to hand, each in
turn strengthening them with its own formative
will, till at last in their cumulative force they
should be powerful enough to move the world.
He saw now that it was not for her own sake,
nor even for the sakes of those who dwelt within
her walls, that Gumilcund had grown up from
the desert and taken a place amongst the cities
of the world. She was to be an example&mdash;a
living type of what might be, on a large scale
and everywhere, when wealth and science and
the white heat of enthusiasm&mdash;that heat in
which self perishes&mdash;are brought together and
allowed unchecked to exercise their influence
upon the life and destiny of nations. They&mdash;his
predecessors&mdash;had been able to do no more than
give the sign. The prejudices of their friends of
the West, and the circumstances of their own
lives, narrowed down to the small issues of an
Asiatic society, had tied their hands. To him&mdash;a
child of the West in a truer sense than they
could ever have been&mdash;belonged the larger life.
Had he the strength and wisdom to use it as he
should? He would at least try. And then his
thoughts flew to Grace&mdash;his white dove&mdash;his
darling. She had the wisdom that he lacked.
She had more than wisdom. She had heroism,
and the passion of self-renunciation and deep
spiritual insight, which, however we may
imagine of ourselves, are better understood and
more widely appreciated in the East than in the
West. Grace! But would she&mdash;could she&mdash;help
him? His mind strayed back over the
past few days, blissful for all their suffering, and
his lips parted in a smile of hope. She had said
she loved him. The sweet confession, true, he
knew, as she was true, was still ringing in his
ears. Would she, then, do what his mother
could not? Would she give up country and
race and come to him? Would she live here
in Gumilcund, letting the beautiful radiance of
her woman's life shine through and overcome
the mists of custom, and the harsh and cruel
caste-prejudices, which have separated Hinduism
from the rest of the world and made of its
votaries a people apart? That was the question
which the next few days must decide.</p>

<p>There rose a vision before him, as he thought.
He seemed to see in imagination how his hand,
in passing on the sacred trust, might impress
a new form upon it. His predecessors had
founded a State and built a city. He might
mould a society. His thoughts, having reached
this stage, were becoming incoherent and wild,
when Hoosanee, who had heard him stirring,
came in with his morning meal. Hoosanee
looked superb. He was dressed in snowy
white, while a turban of pale gold, in the
front of which glittered a small diamond star,
given to him long ago by Byrajee Pirtha Raj,
surrounded his dusky brows and fell in voluminous
folds to his waist.</p>

<p>'Why, Hoosanee,' said Tom, raising himself
on his elbow, 'how gorgeous you are this morning!
You look much more of a prince than I do.'</p>

<p>'My master must remember that he is not in
the jungle,' said Hoosanee, his dark face flushing
with pleasure.</p>

<p>'And the gay dress is the sign of the joyful
heart,' said Tom. 'Well! I think you are right.
Have you any news for me?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Excellency. I have seen my sister,
Sumbaten, and the little baba, Aglaia. Grace
Sahib slept well last night, and she is sleeping
still.'</p>

<p>'Thank heaven!' said Tom fervently. 'I
hope they will not awake her. And the other
ladies, Hoosanee&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'There is one who would have speech of
your Excellency. I met her in the house in the
garden, where the mem sahibs take choto hasari.
She asked me many questions. The last time we
saw her, Sahib,' said Hoosanee, a smile overspreading
his face, 'it was the work of the rajah's
servant to put questions to her.'</p>

<p>'Ah! poor Mrs. Lyster! And admirably
you did it!' said Tom, laughing. 'I wonder,
by the bye, if she thinks you artful still.'</p>

<p>'She spoke to me with kindness, Sahib.'</p>

<p>'They have told her what a hero you are,
Hoosanee. Well! get my bath ready, and give
me my things! No one from outside will come
in yet. I will meet the ladies in the summer-house.'</p>

<p>All of them but Grace were there&mdash;Lucy,
looking a little pale after the excitement of the
night before, and Mrs. Durant, with Kit pressed
close by her side, and Mrs. Lyster, who wore her
Indian dress with a strange shyness, and Aglaia,
all smiles and gladness, and little Dick and his
mother.</p>

<p>When they saw the rajah, who was dressed
as an Indian of rank, coming along the path that
led to their retreat, they rose from the table and
went out to meet him. Aglaia and little Dick
were first. They ran into his arms, and he
caught them both up joyfully, glad, perhaps, to
hide his slight embarrassment in the warmth of
the children's boisterous welcome. 'Oh! how
lovely everything is!' said Aglaia rapturously.
'You won't go away again, Daddy Tom?'</p>

<p>'Not till I take you back to England with
me, Aglaia.' And then he turned to the other
ladies, a boyish flush on his face, which exercise
and exposure to the sun had bronzed almost to
the native hue.</p>

<p>'It is too bad of you to disturb yourselves,'
he said. 'I should not have come so early, only
I thought that, as you were taking breakfast
out-of-doors, you would give me a corner at the
table.'</p>

<p>'Of course we will,' cried Lucy. 'It's such a
rapture to see any one. Mrs. Lyster was just
wishing&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Never mind what I wished. Let me speak
for myself, Lucy,' said Mrs. Lyster, advancing
and looking at the rajah shyly. 'Mr. Gregory&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Tom smiled. 'So you have found me out at
last, my dear old friend,' he said, shaking her
cordially by the hand. 'I am cleverer than
you. Dark as it was the other night, I found
you out at once&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'And yet you said nothing?'</p>

<p>'Ah! I was burning to speak, but I dared
not. Our safety and yours depended on the
fidelity with which I was able to play my part.
I had to be the Indian rajah, and nothing else.
A word in English might have lost us. But my
happiness in knowing that it was you whom we
had helped was none the less, I can assure you.
And your companions&mdash;how are they?'</p>

<p>'So well, poor boys, that they are burning
to be on the move! The Resident can scarcely
keep them quiet. It was a happy Providence
that brought you our way.'</p>

<p>'Happy for me,' said Tom feelingly. 'Do
you know that you gave us the clue we wanted?
My artful servant,' he smiled&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Now,' broke in Mrs. Lyster, with Irish impetuosity,
'that is really too bad of you. You
heard what I said.'</p>

<p>'I said to myself then that I would make you
laugh about it later,' said Tom. 'But come into
the summer-house. Oh!' as she continued to
look at him questioningly, 'I will tell you all
about it presently. I am not so much of an
imposition as you imagine.'</p>

<p>He turned to the others, and gave them a
cheerful good-morning. It was such a meal as
he had often shared in the verandahs of English
bungalows. A silver urn, over which Mrs.
Durant presided, steamed at one end of the
table, where tea and coffee were being made in
the most approved English fashion, and white
bread, cakes hot from the oven, platters of snowy
rice, scrambled eggs and curried fowl were
being laid out daintily by the well-trained
attendants.</p>

<p>'How delightful this is!' said Tom. 'It
seems like coming home. No, no, Mrs. Durant,'
as she handed him a cup of tea. 'I am not so
much of a prince as all that. Help the others
first! It is too much happiness to have my
friends here to wait upon. What!' looking
back at the face of one of the attendants.</p>

<p>The man grinned from ear to ear, showing a
row of perfect teeth. 'Excellency, the little
Sahib would have it so!' he said in broken
Hindoostani.</p>

<p>'So you and Bâl Narîn are inseparables, are
you?' said Tom to Kit. 'What will you do
when he goes back to Nepaul?'</p>

<p>'He mustn't go,' said Kit stoutly. 'You
want a shikari here.'</p>

<p>'To hunt the jackal. We have no other
wild animals in Gumilcund, Kit.'</p>

<p>'Then we must import some,' said the child
gravely. 'Two or three elephants, and a tiger
or so, and a few head of sambre. That would
be enough. In a few years there'd be a lot, and
we'd have no end of fun.'</p>

<p>Tom laughed, and turned to Mrs. Durant.</p>

<p>'What do you say to your son?' he said.
'Haven't his travels made quite a man of him?'</p>

<p>'I don't know about that,' said Mrs. Durant,
who was watching her little boy with fascinated
eyes. 'But I know he is more of a darling than
ever.'</p>

<p>Here Kit, not wishing to be seized and kissed
in the presence of Bâl Narîn, edged away from
his mother and made a remark in a low voice to
Aglaia about the general jolliness of things. He
wanted to know furthermore what she generally
did after breakfast, and proposed a little turn in
the town, offering to take the greatest care of her.</p>

<p>Lucy overheard him, and burst into a fit of
laughter. Then she sprang up and said she
would see whether Grace was awake, and might
she take any message from his Excellency the
rajah?</p>

<p>His Excellency's colour rose after a very
boyish fashion, which made the ladies feel
friendly towards him, when Lucy asked him this
question.</p>

<p>'No, no,' he blurted out&mdash;'that is, I daresay
I shall see her myself presently. But if I may, I
will wait to hear your report.'</p>

<p>Lucy went off, smiling to herself over the
pretty little romance, which gave life a fillip that
had been sadly lacking to it of late.</p>

<p>After a few moments, during which Tom,
who was extraordinarily agitated, had left the
little company at the breakfast-table and strolled
to meet her, she came tripping back. He
watched her face, which was a very mobile one.
It was serious, not sad; and this, he thought,
augured well.</p>

<p>'How is your cousin?' he said, as quietly as
he could.</p>

<p>'I can't quite tell yet,' answered Lucy. 'But
she knows where she is, and she knows me,
which I don't think she did last night.'</p>

<p>'You will keep her quiet?' said Tom wistfully.
He was half regretting the days of travel,
when she depended upon him for everything.</p>

<p>'Yes; I think so. Sumbaten will take in
her breakfast. She asked if we had seen you,'
said Lucy, with an enchanting smile.</p>

<p>'And you told her I was here?'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes! I told her, and she just smiled,
as if she was glad to hear we were so much
honoured, and said that she hoped she would
see you a little later. She was very eager
about news from Meerut.'</p>

<p>'You have heard lately?'</p>

<p>'Yes; I had a long letter from Trixy&mdash;do
you know Trixy, by the bye?'</p>

<p>'Do I know Trixy?' said Tom, his face
lighting up. 'I should rather think so! She
is one of my best friends and dearest enemies, if
you can understand the anomaly. Would it be
indiscreet to ask what she wrote to you?'</p>

<p>'Not in the least, Sir Paladin,' said Lucy,
laughing, while, for the third time that morning,
Tom felt the dark flush mounting to his face.
'She writes that Meerut is waking up. But I
dare say you will have heard that already.
The private news is that General Elton&mdash;my
uncle, you know&mdash;is in his element, helping to
restore order in the district, and that my poor
dear aunt is distracted with anxiety to come on
here at once.'</p>

<p>'I wish she could come,' said Tom. 'I have
written to ask if it could be managed.'</p>

<p>'Oh, have you?' cried Lucy, the slightly
artificial tone that had been apparent in her
manner giving place to the most genuine eagerness.
'And do you think she will be able to
come?'</p>

<p>'It will depend very much upon herself and
General Elton. Personally, I don't think there
would be any risk if she was properly attended.
You would be glad to see her?'</p>

<p>'Glad!' cried Lucy, clasping her hands. 'I
should be simply wild! And Grace&mdash;dearest
Grace!&mdash;I believe it would do her more good
than anything else. I sat beside her bed half
the night, poor darling! Not that I was afraid
of anything, you know; but that it was so
delightful&mdash;such a rest and happiness&mdash;just to
feast my eyes upon her. She spoke in her sleep
once, and I bent over her to catch her words.
"Take it away, mother," she said, "take it
away! I can't bear it!" I moved her pillow
and she half-opened her eyes and smiled. But
a little later she cried out again, and there was
fear in her voice&mdash;fear and horror&mdash;"Mother is
dead!" she said. "Mother is dead, or she
would come." I whispered to her that she was
not dead&mdash;that she was coming; and then my
poor darling smiled again, and lay quite still,
looking as beautiful as an angel.'</p>

<p>Lucy's eyes were full of tears, and her voice
was husky long before she came to the end of
her little story. As for Tom, he could not so
much as answer her. And so they stood silent
for a few moments, he looking down absently
into the basin of water, by whose marble brim
they had stopped to have their little talk.</p>

<p>It was embarrassing to Lucy, and she began
again presently, moving as she spoke towards
the door of the pavilion in the garden. 'We
get such longings out here for the home faces,'
she said, with a plaintive little smile. 'And in
England we don't care. Sometimes we are
stupid enough to think we would as soon be
without them. At Nowgong, you know, I was
getting perfectly ill with my longing to see
some of them. And mother and father, who
are at Lucknow, heard of it, and Grace was
staying with them, having a first-rate time of it
too! and she left everything and came to me.
She is an angel! an angel!' said little Lucy
tremulously. 'If anything happened to her it
would break my heart. But it will be all right
as soon as Aunt Grace comes.'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes, all right! Thank you for saying
so,' said Tom hoarsely. He held out his hand.
'You will take care of her meanwhile, Lucy?'</p>

<p>She pressed it warmly. 'Take care of her!
Of course I will, as much as I can.'</p>

<p>'And if there is anything she wants&mdash;anything
you think would be better changed, you
will let me know. You see'&mdash;blushing and
fidgeting&mdash;'I am a novice about all these things.
I don't really know what ladies want.'</p>

<p>'Then your imagination is better than most
people's knowledge,' said Lucy, laughing. 'I
have never seen anything like the arrangements
of this place&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>But here Tom was called away. It was the
hour when he had arranged to meet the chief
men of the city in his private hall of audience,
and Hoosanee had come, at his request, to
remind him of the promise.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The rajah went away with his heart vibrating
sorrowfully; but in the business of the day,
which claimed his full attention, he regained the
serenity and even, in some degree, the exaltation
of the morning.</p>

<p>There was much to be done. From the hour
of the forenoon, when he left the ladies in the
garden-pavilion, until the sun was sinking behind
the low hills that shut in the city to the west, he
had not an hour to spare.</p>

<p>He carried out literally the programme
which he had laid down for himself when he
received his mother's letter. In the inner
council and in the open court he proclaimed to
the people that his instincts and theirs had not
deceived them. He was the true son of Byrajee
Pirtha Raj, and their ruler by right of succession.</p>

<p>The elders received the intelligence quietly.
They were glad to hear him acknowledge that
he belonged to them, and his explanation of the
reasons that had led him to leave the city, with
his well-balanced relation of the measures he had
taken in his absence to strengthen the hands of
the English and to secure peace to Gumilcund,
gave them perfect satisfaction. But they showed
no surprise and very little emotion.</p>

<p>Outside it was different. Here the people&mdash;the
craftsmen and mechanics&mdash;the small merchants
and aged householders&mdash;were gathered
together; and it may be that an electric current
of pent-up feeling streamed outward from them
to the comely youth who stood above them with
his nerves and brain on fire. Certain it is that
he told his tale after a different fashion to them.
In the pose of the fine figure, drawn to its full
height&mdash;in the flashing eyes and dilated nostrils&mdash;above
all, in the noble words, wherein he
expressed his reverence for those who had gone
before him, and his desire to follow in their footsteps&mdash;pride
of his lineage could be plainly
read. He was proud to be the son of Byrajee
Pirtha Raj; he was glad at heart of the destiny
that bound him, for his life, to this people. So
at least they read him, and the Asiatic crowd,
which is sensitive and subtle in its perception
of feeling, and as responsive to sympathy as a
woman or child, received his tale with demonstrations
of a joy so deep and passionate that it
thrilled him to the heart.</p>

<p>He would not allow too much time to the
ebullition of feeling. His speech over, the court
opened, and, for more than two hours, he sat
patiently in his alcove above the pillared and
porticoed court investigating the cases that were
brought before him.</p>

<p>And next, after a hasty lunch, he ordered
out Snow-queen and rode through the city,
showing himself to those who had not been able
to come up to the court, and inspecting the
works that had been in progress since his
departure.</p>

<p>In the course of his wanderings, he was
amused to meet Aglaia and Kit walking together
through the town, with Sumbaten, who looked
much puzzled and a little distressed by the innovation,
walking behind them.</p>

<p>Kit, of course, hailed him joyfully. 'We're
having no end of fun,' he said. 'Isn't everything
jolly?'</p>

<p>'Particularly jolly, I think,' answered Tom,
laughing. 'But don't keep Aglaia out too late,
Kit.'</p>

<p>Then a voice from the near distance hailed
him reassuringly, and he saw that the devoted
Bâl Narîn was not far from his little Sahib.
Billy, in his shikari's dress, looked very
much like a fish out of water. The streets of
Gumilcund, which to-day were freshly swept and
garlanded, were not so congenial to him as the
jungle and the mountains; and the bourgeois
life of ease and comfort was already beginning to
pall upon his fiery soul. But, for the moment,
he had constituted himself Kit's guardian, and
Tom was perfectly easy about the child.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h5><a name="CHAPTER_L" id="CHAPTER_L">CHAPTER L</a></h5>

<h4>VISHNUGUPTA, THE PRIEST</h4>


<p>The sun had set, and that lovely rose-lilac glow,
which, for a few moments of the evening, makes
the skies of the East so entrancingly beautiful,
was wrapping heaven and earth in its mystical
radiance, when Tom, having finished his day's
work, returned to the palace. A syce took
Snow-queen, and he went in thoughtfully to his
own rooms, wondering if he ought to ask to see
Grace, or if it would be better to wait until the
following day.</p>

<p>It may be as well to say here that, in the
intervals for quiet thought which the business of
the day had permitted him, he had made up his
mind fully as to his course of action. There
should be no repetition of the mistakes of the
past. That one outpouring of heart, drawn from
him by Grace's anguish of spirit, he could forgive
himself. Until he had heard from General or
Lady Elton, there should be nothing more of the
same kind. He owed it to her, and to their
mutual relations&mdash;she, a fugitive in his city, a
guest in his house: he, the one to whom the
honour and happiness of saving her had been
granted&mdash;to set a seal on the door of his lips, for
the present. He owed it to the future&mdash;to the
position which it was his dearest hope and desire
she might one day occupy&mdash;to do nothing in a
corner, or without the consent and approval of
her friends.</p>

<p>But none the less for his prudent resolve to
hold himself in check, was his desire to see her
and hear her voice.</p>

<p>As he was thinking about these things,
Hoosanee came to meet him with a message from
the English ladies. They had sent to know if
his Excellency the rajah would do them the
honour of joining them at their evening meal.
He smiled at the punctiliousness of the invitation,
answered it with a ready assent, and, about half-an-hour
later, found himself on the marble staircase
that led up to the pillared hall of the
zenana.</p>

<p>A little to his surprise, he saw that the hall
was empty, and he was about to throw himself
down on one of the settees and wait, when a
murmur of voices from the daïs, which was
hidden by a screen of palms and lilies from the
body of the hall, attracted his attention. He
went on to the foot of the steps that led up to it,
and there stopped for a moment, half paralysed
with surprise. As a picture nothing could have
been more beautiful and striking than the scene
upon which his eyes rested. The ladies were to
dine on the daïs, and the centre of its space was
occupied by a table, where flowers and rich
tropical fruits and sweetmeats, with sparkling
glass and silver, were laid out on snowy linen.
At the head of the table, on a low couch, draped
with embroidered stuffs, a figure that seemed to
concentrate upon itself all the light in the room
was reclining. It was that of a woman, dressed
in a loose robe of white and gold. Her head,
from which the veil had fallen back, was propped
up on a little hand, so delicate in its blue-veined
transparency that the burden seemed to be too
heavy for it; her pale face, overspread at this
moment by a faint tinge of colour, looked out
from its halo of golden hair, with the purity and
stillness of a saint in a mediæval altar-piece, and
her lips were moving in low, impassioned words
that throbbed through the silence like a prayer.
Meanwhile, at a little distance from the couch,
his large hands with their curiously knotted
joints clasped round his knees, and his dark,
strongly-marked face lit by deep eyes which
shone with a dreamy light turned meditatively
towards hers, sat a figure so different that it
might have been placed there for a foil.</p>

<p>But it was not this that made the half-unconscious
watcher start and pause, and feel,
for a moment, as if his senses had been playing
him a trick. It was that in the difference there
was a likeness. In the solemn fire that seemed
to kindle these two faces, in their meditativeness,
in their dreamy enthusiasm, there was something
which brought them together. Vishnugupta,
the proud Indian mystic, and the simple English
girl who had looked the King of Terrors in the
face, and, for the sake of another, had vanquished
him, met that night on a common ground of
sympathy.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Then by strange art she kneaded fire and snow</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Together, tempering the repugnant mass</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With liquid love&mdash;&mdash;"</span><br />
</p>

<p>The words sprang to his mind as he gazed.
He went forward, and the spell was broken.
Grace looked up, gave a little start, as if she had
just awoke from a dream, and held out her
hand with a radiant smile of welcome.</p>

<p>Vishnugupta rose, bent his head with the
proud humility of the Brahmin, drew his robe
about his head, and, making answer neither by
word nor sign to the rajah's entreaty that he
would stay for a little while, passed slowly out
of the apartment.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The priest had scarcely gone before there
came a flutter of garments and a gay noise of
laughter and voices in eager conversation from
behind the screen that separated the hall and
the sleeping-rooms. Then Lucy's little saucy
face appeared above the palisade that bordered
the daïs.</p>

<p>'Has he gone?' she whispered.</p>

<p>'Do you mean Vishnugupta?' said Tom,
laughing at her mysterious expression.</p>

<p>'Is that his name? What a name! And
oh! what a person!' cried Lucy. She ran up
the steps and brought her charming little person,
bewitchingly dressed in a long Indian cashmere
robe, drawn in at the waist with a golden girdle,
into full view. 'I was with Grace when he came
in,' she said. 'I have been arranging the table,
and I was arranging her. He looked at me and
I withered up to nothing. But as Grace seemed
to take to him and his talk like a duck to water,
I just ran away and left them alone. Darling,'
turning to Grace, 'what, in the name of heaven,
were you talking about? He has been with you
more than half an hour.'</p>

<p>Then the others came in, all of them looking
curious. But Grace lay back with a smile on
her lips, and a strange, inscrutable expression in
her eyes.</p>

<p>'It was very good of you,' said Tom gently.
'But you must not let these people tire you. I
wonder who admitted Vishnugupta.'</p>

<p>'Please let him come again if he likes,' said
Grace. 'He does not tire me in the least. I
think, do you know, he has done me good.' She
smiled more naturally than Tom had seen her
smile since the day when he found her in the
jungle.</p>

<p>'Oh! if he does you good, he shall come
every day, and I will thank and bless him to the
end of my life,' said Tom gaily. 'But now, may
we draw you up to the table? We are to have
a merry evening, you know, Grace.' His voice
shook a little, and, in spite of the brave effort to
be cheerful, the muscles of his face contracted
painfully. He could not help seeing how fragile
she was.</p>

<p>But she took up his words at once. 'Yes,
yes,' she said; 'a merry evening. Let us fancy
ourselves in England, on the banks of the
Thames. Thank you,' as they drew in her
couch. 'I am sorry to be so troublesome. Kit,
will you sit near me, and Aglaia next? No, no,
Rajah Sahib; you must take the place of
honour. So! We can all see you now! Has
he really changed so much, Mrs. Lyster?'</p>

<p>'Changed! He hasn't changed at all,' cried
the enthusiastic little Irishwoman. 'It's I that
was the idiot not to know him. But I'll never
be so silly again. I promise you that.'</p>

<p>'I'm not quite so sure that it was your fault,
Mrs. Lyster,' said Tom aside. Mrs. Durant and
Lucy were exchanging a little war of words
about some disputed point of the arrangements
of the evening, and Grace was talking merrily
to Kit and Aglaia.</p>

<p>'Do you believe,' he asked abruptly, 'in the
possibility of people living in two individualities?'</p>

<p>She paused for a moment, and then looked
meditatively at Grace. 'Until just lately,' she
said, 'I should have called the question an
absurdity. But&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Please go on,' said Tom breathlessly.</p>

<p>'I have watched her,' whispered Mrs. Lyster.
'She is leading two lives. The priest saw it.
That is what brought him to-day. Don't look
at her; don't let her think you are watching
her. She is very sensitive. It would be the
easiest thing in the world to frighten that pretty
gaiety away. Yes; she is living two lives,
and&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Well! Don't stop&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'It should be encouraged. It is her only
chance.'</p>

<p>'Of what, Mrs. Lyster?'</p>

<p>'Of sanity and life.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean?' (sharply).</p>

<p>'Don't ask me just now. I will tell you by-and-by.
But watch her. Yes&mdash;and talk&mdash;be
gay! I will help you as well as I can. She is
a noble creature&mdash;a heroine all impact&mdash;' said the
warm-hearted little Irishwoman, 'and you are
<i>almost</i> worthy of her, although&mdash;' and here she
pulled up and blushed violently.</p>

<p>'Although I'm not almost, but altogether
a native,' filled in the rajah, a humorous expression
crossing his face. 'Thank you for the compliment.
It is no small one, Mrs. Lyster.'</p>

<p>'Go along with you,' she said, trying to
laugh, though her face and neck were one burning
red. 'I shall be speaking to you presently
in my native Celtic, and telling you that you are
nothing better than a gossoon.'</p>

<p>'Which would enchant me,' said Tom, laughing.
'Anyway'&mdash;seriously&mdash;'we sign to-night
a truce and an alliance.'</p>

<p>'To be sure! though I don't know that I was
ever at war with you,' said Mrs. Lyster.</p>

<p>And thereupon they threw themselves into
the conversation that was going on around
them.</p>

<p>Forgetting her own sorrows, the vivacious
little Irishwoman pulled herself together, brought
out her best jokes and most amusing stories, and
became the life of the party. Lucy followed
her lead. Mrs. Durant, the desire of whose
heart had been fulfilled, had no difficulty in being
lively. They drew out Kit, who made them all
laugh with his funny little sayings. Even the
mother of little Dick condescended to forget her
own dignity and the imminence of the crisis
through which she had been brought, and to
enjoy herself. But long before it was over, Tom
saw, to his distress, that the sudden springing
up of vitality which had enabled Grace to take
part in the gaiety of the others was over. She
lay back on her couch white and still, turning
her large blue-grey eyes from one to another as
the sallies of wit and merry anecdotes flew by,
and smiling now and then vaguely, as though
she was making an effort to follow them, but
could not quite succeed.</p>

<p>The poor fellow was watching her, as a
mother watches a sick child. While he made a
feint of listening to the talk at the table, laughing
when the others laughed to give himself
countenance, and occasionally launching out
feebly a witticism of his own, he never lost a
single expression of the face that was so unutterably
dear to him. Dinner over, he crossed
to where she was lying. 'Grace,' he said, in a
low voice, under cover of the talk, 'what is it?
You are looking worse to-day. Is all this too
much for you?'</p>

<p>'No, no,' she answered, with a smile so gentle
and patient that it thrilled him to the heart.
'And do you know, I really feel better. You
must forgive me for not talking. You know'
(pressing her hand to her head) 'there is something
here still. It won't let me. I get confused.'</p>

<p>'My darling,' he began passionately, and then
checked himself. 'I mustn't be too impulsive
yet,' he said under his breath. 'Afterwards,
Grace, afterwards&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Ah!' she said, with a beautiful indescribable
expression. 'Lucy has written. They will
know in a very short time that I am here.
Perhaps some of them will come. In the meantime&mdash;'
dreamily.</p>

<p>'In the meantime, talk or be silent, as you
please. Do anything! Only get well and
strong, Grace. Only get well and strong!'</p>

<p>'I will try,' she said plaintively. 'Sometimes&mdash;still&mdash;life
seems very sweet.'</p>

<p>'It will not be sometimes&mdash;it will be always,
when you get better,' said Tom earnestly.</p>

<p>But there was a pang at his heart, for all his
cheerful words. For the first time, since he saw
her lying insensible in the hermit's hut in the
jungle, a feeling of despair swept over his young
soul.</p>

<p>He would not&mdash;he could not&mdash;give place
to it. Turning away, lest she should read it in
his eyes, he met a look of sympathy from Mrs.
Lyster. She was far too wise to put it into
words, and he found, somewhat to his relief, that
he must arouse himself, for there was more to
be done.</p>

<p>The Resident had sent word that, with his
visitors, he would call upon the ladies that evening,
and Chunder Singh and Lutfullah, and
several other distinguished Indians, who in the
rajah's absence had been diligent in inquiries
and offers of assistance, had asked permission to
wait upon them also.</p>

<p>It had been decided that the reception should
be held in the little pillared hall, which had been
hung with garlands and banners for the occasion.
Lucy and Mrs. Durant thought it was about
time to go down. Grace was asked what she
would do. Seeing Tom's wistful eyes fixed upon
her, she said that she would like to be present,
if she might be quiet. She had a curious dread
of being alone in those days. But when she
tried to rise, she found that she was too weak.
Tears of vexation filled her eyes, but before they
had time to fall, the rajah and Bâl Narîn, and
Hoosanee and Ganesh had sprung to her couch,
and it was lifted up with all its flowing draperies,
as if it had been a featherweight, and carried
down the steps; Grace smiling through her tears
and begging them not to hurt themselves&mdash;to be
sure to put her down if she was too heavy&mdash;an
entreaty that made the stout Indians laugh.</p>

<p>'Put me a little out of everyone's way,' she
had said to Tom. So he found an arbour-like
corner for her, beautifully shaded with palms
and tree-ferns, whence she could see everything
that went on in the brilliantly-lighted hall,
without being much seen herself. There he put
the couch down. The Indians retired, and he
stooped over her. 'Is that right, Grace?'</p>

<p>'Perfectly right. I shall enjoy myself looking
and listening. And now, Tom, you must
leave me. The Resident and the others will be
here directly.'</p>

<p>'I suppose I must,' he said regretfully. 'I
will come back again in a few moments, to see
how you are.'</p>

<p>And so Grace lay quietly in her corner, and
the anguish in her heart&mdash;the phantom that was
continually rising up to mock her&mdash;was at rest
for a few moments, while, like images in a dream,
the busy little crowd that soon filled the hall,
came and went.</p>

<p>The Resident and the two English officers, and
Chunder Singh and Lutfullah, were brought up
to speak to her. They spoke feelingly, congratulating
her on her escape. She found a few
simple words with which to answer them; but
she could not say much, and the rajah took care
that she should not be made to talk more than
she liked.</p>

<p>How deep her gratitude was for his watchful
tenderness it would be impossible to express.
Once or twice, when he passed, she looked up
at him with a wistful smile, and once she touched
his arm lightly with her thin fingers, whispering,
'You are so good to me!'</p>

<p>'Good!' he echoed. 'Oh! Grace, if you
only knew!'</p>

<p>And then, for an instant, the warm colour
flooded his face, and his eyes shone with a wonderful
light; but, not daring to trust himself to
speak, he turned away, leaving Mrs. Lyster on
guard.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the hall, which had surely
never seen so strange a gathering before, there
was plenty of fun and good fellowship. The
party at the Residency had just been reinforced
by Mr. Montgomery's wife, a handsome and
accomplished woman, her sister, a pretty, timid
girl fresh from England, and several other ladies,
who had come to Gumilcund on the Resident's
invitation, leaving, in more cases than one, desolated
homes behind them. There were besides
the two young officers&mdash;Irish, by the bye, both
of them&mdash;who had come in with Mrs. Lyster,
quite well now and up to all sorts of fun. And
so the evening glided on merrily. To an onlooker
there might have seemed to be something
pathetic about their mirth. Scarcely one of the
Europeans but had some deep present anxiety
to endure, or some recent loss to mourn; but
they were English ladies and gentlemen, and
they knew how to control themselves. For the
sake of one another and their entertainer, they
would not be gloomy or morose. The two young
officers sang comic songs, and Mr. Montgomery,
the Resident, brought out his violin and played
dance-tunes which made the feet of the younger
ladies twitch to be off, and brave Mrs. Lyster, who
was fighting all night with a desperate longing to
run away and have a good cry, talked and laughed
and told travellers' tales, charming them all with
her wit and vivacity. The grave Indians, who
knew through what deep waters many of these
poor women had passed, were surprised at their
spirits. Happily for some of them, it was not
kept up late. The Resident and his party, with
hearty expressions of thanks and goodwill, took
leave of them long before midnight, and the
Indian visitors followed their example immediately.
Then poor Mrs. Lyster sat down and
covered her face with her hands. 'I couldn't
have stood it another five minutes. Oh! do all
of you think me a brute?' she cried, lifting up
her haggard face.</p>

<p>'Don't! Don't!' cried Lucy piteously. 'You
will make me cry.'</p>

<p>'I think you one of the bravest of women.
I always did,' said Tom. 'Do you remember
the storm? No one was so plucky as you.'</p>

<p>'Do I remember it?' said Mrs. Lyster, with
a queer little smile. 'Why, it was nothing&mdash;child's
play. But come, my son of Anak, pick
up the couch and carry our invalid inside. Be
quiet, my dear!' to Grace. 'You're not to be
allowed to stir a step to-night. Carry her in,
Mr. Rajah, and then take your retinue away and
say good-night. We will face the terrors of the
silent hours together.'</p>

<p>After that the days glided quietly one into
the other. Every morning the rajah met his
family, as he used to call the ladies and children
who had found a refuge in the palace, at breakfast,
in the pretty garden-pavilion. And pleasant
breakfasts they were, although Grace was never
present: for some one&mdash;Kit, or Aglaia, or Mrs.
Lyster, or Lucy&mdash;had always something encouraging
to say about her. During the day he gave
himself without reserve to business and study,
and cultivating useful and kindly relations with
the people about him, making meanwhile such
progress in the knowledge of Indian affairs, and
gaining such insight into hidden depths of life
and character, and into the scope and meaning
of the philosophies and religions of the country,
as would sometimes surprise even himself. After
sunset, when the work of the day was over, he
met his friends again, and they would all take
their evening meal together, talking over past
and present, discussing hopefully the state of
affairs in the country, and exchanging the news
which the mails of the day had brought in.</p>

<p>Sometimes Grace would join them at these
dinners in the hall, and sometimes not; but she
always sent him affectionate messages, of which
Aglaia was generally the bearer, and he seldom
spent a day without seeing her once. Later he
looked back upon those early days at Gumilcund,
full to the brim of joyful interests, and flooded
with the light of hope, as some of the happiest
in his life.</p>

<p>Gradually a dull pain&mdash;a terror to which he
could not give a name&mdash;began to encroach upon
their sweetness. Why did not Grace pick up
her strength? At first her weakness was easily
to be accounted for. But surely the time had
come when they might look for improvement.
The rest, the freedom from anxiety, and the daily
companionship of her friends ought, by this time,
to be taking some effect. Sometimes, when they
met, he would try to cheat himself into the belief
that she was better and brighter; but the absence
of vital strength was a fact that, in spite
of himself, pressed home to his heart. Day after
day he saw the same white face, the same patient
smile, the same sorrow-haunted eyes. Day after
day he was the witness of efforts so pathetic that
he would entreat her sometimes not to make
them. 'Be patient, my beloved!' he would
whisper; and all the time, in his own heart there
would be a tumult of fierce impatience, a gnawing
of angry pain that almost unnerved him.</p>

<p>But this was not all. He was conscious&mdash;they
were all conscious&mdash;of a mental cloud&mdash;a veil
that seemed at times to wrap her away from them.</p>

<p>'Grace is changed. I don't know what to
make of her. But I wish&mdash;oh! I do wish&mdash;that
her mother would come,' Lucy cried out one
morning when Tom asked her the usual question.
Mrs. Lyster gave her a warning look, but she
went on. 'Yes; I can't help it. I must speak.
Something ought to be done.'</p>

<p>'What can be done, Lucy?' said Tom, whose
face had turned perfectly grey.</p>

<p>'Don't mind Lucy. She is speaking wildly,'
said Mrs. Lyster. 'She forgets&mdash;we all forget&mdash;that
there are experiences which nothing but the
healing hand of time&mdash;the slow passage of the
years&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>She broke down, for her voice was choked
with sobs.</p>

<p>'I know,' said Lucy penitently. 'But, dear
Mrs. Lyster, you have suffered more than any of
us, and you are not so strange, so reserved.'</p>

<p>'My dear child, I am much older than
Grace, and I have the Irish elasticity of temper,
I suppose. We can laugh with the tears on our
faces; and I thank God for it. And now, like
a darling, run off and look after the children,
and leave the rajah to me.'</p>

<p>Lucy hesitated for a moment, looked at
them with a curious half-mutinous expression in
her face, and then turned away.</p>

<p>The other ladies had already left the summer-house,
so that Mrs. Lyster and Tom were alone.</p>

<p>'Thank you,' he said, looking at her with
strained, eager eyes.</p>

<p>She shook her head sadly.</p>

<p>'Tell me what to do?' he cried out passionately.
'I love her. You know this already. I
would give my life&mdash;my blood drawn from me
painfully drop by drop&mdash;to save her a single
pang. The thought of her trouble is agony to
me&mdash;torture. What are we to do? Shall I
send to Agra for an English doctor? I might.'</p>

<p>'I am afraid, my poor friend, that no doctor
would do her any good. The disease lies deeper
than medicine can cure.'</p>

<p>'What would, then? Tell me, for heaven's
sake!'</p>

<p>'She has something on her mind,' said Mrs.
Lyster doubtfully.</p>

<p>'I know it&mdash;I know it. A fancied trouble.
If some one reasonable and wise, like you, were
to talk it over with her, she might be persuaded
to put it from her. Won't you try?'</p>

<p>'I dare not,' said Mrs. Lyster, in a broken
voice.</p>

<p>Tom started. 'I don't understand,' he said
confusedly.</p>

<p>'And I am afraid I can't explain,' she said.
'There is something about her&mdash;a whiteness of
soul, a majesty. There, I am stumbling about
as usual. In plain English, I can't get near her,
and I am afraid to attempt it.'</p>

<p>'And yet&mdash;&mdash;' began Tom.</p>

<p>'And yet,' filled in his companion, 'she can
be bright enough sometimes. Yes; that is just
what I told you before, she has her hours. And'
(mysteriously) 'I will tell you a curious thing.
That Brahmin, with the wild face and unpronounceable
name, does her more good than
anyone else. He came in yesterday, just before
dinner. I was in the hall with her, and I
stayed because I was curious; but of course I
was not quick enough at Hindoostani to pick up
all they said. You remember how calm she
looked in the evening. We all remarked it.
But it was so before. She is easier, brighter
altogether, when she has been having one of her
long wild talks with that wild man.'</p>

<p>'Why wild, Mrs. Lyster?'</p>

<p>'Why, because, so far as I can make out,
they seem to be scaling heights and plunging
into depths of which we poor mortals have no
idea. But I will tell you one thing that struck
me, his manner to her. We&mdash;well! he doesn't
take any notice of us. I don't believe he sees
us. He treats <i>her</i> with a reverence that, coming
from a man like him, is one of the most touching
things I have ever met with in all my experience.
It is just as if' (in an awed tone) 'he was
talking to one <i>on the other side</i>.'</p>

<p>'Don't, don't!' cried Tom piteously. He
was trembling even to the lips, which were ashy
pale; but he made a feeble effort to smile. 'You
come of an imaginative race, Mrs. Lyster,' he
said. 'I understand that, of course. But for
heaven's sake, let us have prose, not poetry! It
would be too dreadful to let her slip through
our fingers now! Can <i>nothing</i> be done?'</p>

<p>'We shall know more when her mother
comes,' said Mrs. Lyster. And that was all.</p>

<p>The young rajah went to his work that
morning with a heart so full that it seemed to
him as if bands of steel, growing harder and
tighter every moment, were winding themselves
about him, and pressing out his life. Like a
mournful voice&mdash;an echo of something he had
heard before, Mrs. Lyster's words repeated
themselves in his brain. 'On the other side.'
What if there was some strange, mystical truth
in them? What if in that trance the pure,
strong spirit had winged its flight to the heavenly
sphere&mdash;had found its home there&mdash;and now
was only kept to its earthly tabernacle by their
love, and tears, and prayers? It was a terrible
thought. Again and again he tried to put it
away from him, but it returned unceasingly,
through that long and miserable day, taking the
strangest forms, as it swept through his mind.
In the evening, when he went up to the hall, he
half expected to hear that Grace was worse.
But she was in her place, and though she was as
pale and fragile as usual, she greeted him with a
smile of unusual brightness.</p>

<p>Dinner over, he sat down by her couch.
'Grace, dearest,' he said, 'I wish you would tell
me what you and Vishnugupta talk about when
you are together. I am, in some sort, a protégé
of his, and yet, do you know, I have never been
able to draw him out, as you do?'</p>

<p>Grace looked up at him, an expression of
childlike wonder in her eyes. 'Draw him out!'
she echoed. 'I don't think I quite understand.'</p>

<p>'Well, then, make him talk.'</p>

<p>'Ah!' she said, smiling. 'But, indeed, it is
quite the contrary. He has made me talk.'</p>

<p>'How, Grace?'</p>

<p>'I don't know. I think there is a power
about him&mdash;a fascination. Do you remember
what I told you one day when we were travelling?
How I looked round me&mdash;above&mdash;below&mdash;on
every side, and saw nothing but misery and pain&mdash;how
I could not believe in God&mdash;could not
even thank Him for saving me?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I remember,' said Tom.</p>

<p>'And after that,' she went on, 'I felt, but I
couldn't speak. It was all in here&mdash;burning&mdash;burning&mdash;but
no words&mdash;an awful indescribable
loneliness. You were all about me, loving me,
helping me, caring for me so kindly, and I was
like one apart&mdash;a spirit in prison. Then I saw
this Brahmin-prophet. It was the evening we
came in.' She spoke rapidly, and with a curious
exultation, which had the strangest effect upon
her listeners&mdash;for there were two now, Mrs.
Lyster having joined them. 'I saw him standing
in the road&mdash;such a strange figure! It
frightened poor little Kit; but I&mdash;ah! I can't
tell you what it was&mdash;he looked at me, and it
seemed to me as if he were looking straight
down into my soul, as if he knew how I felt. And
yet I did not tremble. I asked him to come and
see me, and he came. He sat down there. He
said nothing, not a single word; but I spoke; it
was as if an angel had come down and loosened
my tongue, letting the burning thoughts free.'</p>

<p>'Did Vishnugupta understand you?' said
Tom.</p>

<p>'He did more than understand. He explained
me to myself. Listen, my beloved, and see how
overpowering&mdash;how beautiful it is. We are
stretching out our hands in the darkness&mdash;looking
for God&mdash;weeping because He does not answer
our prayers, and He is here within us. We shall
part, or we shall think that we part, but it is not
so. We cannot part, we meet eternally in the
bosom of the Divine. But before we can know
this, and enter into His peace, the self must be
slain&mdash;will&mdash;desire&mdash;love of the things that
are not He. Listen again! I wondered, you
know, where the evil came from&mdash;pain, misery,
cruelty. I know now. These are the things
to which the self will grow in its darkness. But
there is hope, for in the sting is the cure.
Through the evil&mdash;through the bitter pain and
misery&mdash;the vision is born. The poison has a
heart of healing. If there were none of this
misery that revolts our ignorance, the self would
go on, building its palaces about it till the
Divine was shut out. As it is, we grow weary at
last, and we lay ourselves down at His feet. I
thought it was a dream at first; but he spoke
to me again, and each time he spoke the vision
became clearer. He says they have known
it here for thousands of years. It has been
growing and fading&mdash;growing and fading; but
there were always some who held it fast, and
when faith was weak, and many had gone astray,
and the clue to the labyrinth was in danger of
being lost, then a revealer&mdash;a God-sent teacher
came.'</p>

<p>There was a pause. Neither of her companions
spoke. Mrs. Lyster was looking out
before her with bewildered eyes. If this was
love-making, it was the strangest she had
ever heard of. Tom had covered his face
with his hands. It seemed to him that she
was moving further and further away from
them, and he could not speak for the sorrowful
aching at his heart. Then she put out her
hand, and, with a smile of the most divine compassion
and love, touched his arm. 'Dearest,'
she said, 'I must tell you something more. They
are expecting another revealer. He will be different
from any who have gone before him, for
the sphere will be larger. New lights have been
dawning upon the nations, and new truths, forced
painfully from the silence by the higher minds,
are waiting to be shown to the people. He will
know all these. He will be of the West by his
training, of the East by his nature. He will have
the science and learning of the New World, and
the self-forgetting passion of the Old. For years
he will be content to learn&mdash;watching and waiting
for the happy moment. Then, when he is
sure of himself and sure of them, he will speak&mdash;here,
in this wonderful country, which has
given so many wonderful things to the world, and
thousands upon thousands will follow him. This
is what Vishnugupta told me, and do you know
what I thought? "Our prophet is here," I
thought to myself. Years upon years to come,
when all this dreadful strife and sore is healed,
and when I, with so many, many others, who had
a part in it, are laid to rest and forgotten, he
will speak the words of life, and then, perhaps,'
her lips parted in a yearning smile, 'he will
remember his love of old time, and these few
days of love and happiness, that his love made
for her, before&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Hush! Grace! Hush!' cried the poor boy
passionately. 'It is you I want&mdash;&mdash;' Mrs.
Lyster turned away weeping, and he broke into
a piteous entreaty that Grace would unsay her
cruel words. But in a moment the words died
away upon his lips, and he was gazing at her with
ashy face and horror-stricken eyes. For the
expression they so much dreaded&mdash;the look of
fear and piteous distress&mdash;had come back into
her face. In the next moment he had recovered
his presence of mind, and was stooping over her
to ask if she wanted anything. 'No,' she said,
trying to smile. 'I am tired;' and then with
white lips and eyes, whose sorrowful yearning
will haunt him to the end of his days, she
besought him to leave her alone.</p>

<h5><a name="CHAPTER_LI" id="CHAPTER_LI">CHAPTER LI</a></h5>

<h4>THE RAJAH WELCOMES A GUEST AND HEARS A
STRANGE STORY</h4>


<p>The next day was full of business, and Tom gave
himself to it with stern self-repression.</p>

<p>He had offered a body of guides and pioneers,
picked men, as skilful with the shovel and the
scaling-ladder as with the sword, to the British
army, which was marching northwards to the
relief of Lucknow. His offer had been accepted,
and to-day they were to set off for Allahabad,
where the troops were congregating. In the
early morning he inspected them, and then,
having given orders that they should be feasted
royally at his expense in the market-place, he
harangued them in the presence of a great concourse
of people, and, mounted on Snow-queen,
marched with them as far as the boundaries of
the State.</p>

<p>Following as it did on an exciting evening
and a heavy sleepless night, the day exhausted
him, and on his return he would not press his
pace. He rode back slowly, his mind, to his own
comfort and relief, almost a blank, so that it was
late in the evening before he reached the palace.</p>

<p>He had left word that he would probably be
late, begging the ladies to dine without him, and
as he passed into his own quarters he felt glad
that he had done so, for he was able for little else
but rest. Here, however, an exciting piece of
news awaited him. Lady Elton had arrived.
He asked how long she had been in the palace,
and found that she must have entered the city by
one gate as he and his men had left by another.
Hoosanee, who was his informant, told him that
she had arrived in a well-equipped travelling-carriage,
and attended by an escort of European
soldiers. These, however, had left her at the gate.</p>

<p>A young lady&mdash;the sister, as Hoosanee had been
told, of Grace Sahib&mdash;came in with her in the
carriage, and an English officer whom Ganesh
had recognised as the Captain Sahib Liston, had
ridden into the city in their company. At the
gate of the palace they had inquired for his Excellency
the rajah. When Hoosanee informed
them of the business on which he was bound,
adding that he might not return till late, the
ladies had left their names with him and gone
on to the zenana, and the Captain Sahib had
proceeded to the Residency, where he would
probably spend the night.</p>

<p>While Hoosanee was giving his master this
news a servant came in with a letter for the
rajah. It was from Lady Elton&mdash;a rapturous,
affectionate, incoherent little note, saying she
had seen Grace, and thanking and blessing him
for all he had done for them. 'My good Trixy
is with me,' she wrote. 'The General would not
let me come without one of the girls, and I think
she will be a comfort to her sister. I will not
see you to-night. When I feel my child's hand
in mine my love and gratitude overcome me.
I could only weep. I could not speak. But
to-morrow morning, as early as you like, we
must meet.' And she added, after a few more
fervent, incoherent words. 'Both the General
and I feel that you belong to us.' Pressing the
letter to his lips, Tom wrote an answer hastily.</p>

<blockquote><p>'My dearest Lady Elton,&mdash;I thank God
from a full heart that you have come in safely.
Command me as if I were your son. It will be
my happiness to serve you. To-morrow, since
it may not be to-night, I will bid you welcome
in person. I am always in the garden early.
You are an early riser, I know. If the journey
has not tired you too much, perhaps you will
meet me there. I must see you <i>alone</i>, if
possible. Brotherly greetings and a warm
welcome to Trixy. Yours always,</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Thomas Gregory</span>.'</p></blockquote>

<p>A long night, haunted by the strangest
dreams, passed over the young rajah's head.
Now he would be chasing Lady Elton about the
garden, trying to speak to her, and seeing her
elude him, and waking up with a start just as his
hand was on her arm. Then he would come
suddenly face to face with her, and she would
begin an incoherent story, which he could not
understand. Again and again he leapt up thinking
it was day, and again and again he composed
himself to sleep; but, do what he would, he
could not rest for the fever of his heart and
brain, and before the sun was up he dressed and
went out into the garden.</p>

<p>Ever afterwards he remembered vividly the
impressions of that morning. He went out into
a still and wonderful world. The green things of
the earth, the flowering shrubs, the palms, the
dark cypresses that lifted their column-like heads
above the lower and lovelier foliage, the water
that flowed in deep channels by the grass&mdash;all
these seemed to be asleep. But a soft wind was
stirring; far away there was a low confused
murmur as of dawning consciousness, and over
all stretched a cloudless heaven, pale and
mysterious, in the zenith, where the little stars
that had shone all night were passing, one by
one, tremulously behind the radiant veil of the
morning, and, on the eastern horizon, tinged with
a dull red, quickening gradually, as if a hand were
fanning it, into flame-colour and saffron. The
beauty and tranquillity seemed for a few moments
to soothe the fever of his heart. He felt a Presence
in the garden. The strange words of the
night before came back to him. <i>We are stretching
out our hands in the darkness&mdash;looking for
God&mdash;and He is here within us.</i> For an instant&mdash;a
wonderful instant, which he remembered years
afterwards with a passionate thrill of gratitude&mdash;a
wild throb of expectation, the Divine was as
near to him as his own quivering flesh and blood.</p>

<p>It was far too early yet for him to expect to
see anyone out; but instinctively his feet turned in
the direction they had so often taken lately, and,
in a few moments, he found himself in the avenue
that led from the English ladies' apartments to
the pavilion where they were accustomed to
meet in the morning.</p>

<p>He had scarcely entered it before he saw at
its farther end, walking away from him into the
open, the figure of a woman in a long grey cloak.
He hastened to overtake it, then stopped, then
went on again. Lady Elton? But could it be?
The slow pace, the uncertain steps, the bent
head, were strangely unlike her. The doubt was
soon laid to rest. In the stillness she had heard
his footsteps behind her, and she turned and
came to meet him. That, too, was a moment
which Tom will remember all his life. It was
not only the pallor of the once comely face and
the attenuation of the form that, when last he
saw it, had been so pleasant to look upon in its
full matronly beauty; it was the expression of
the face, the looking out upon him suddenly like
a spectre in the noontide, of that despair which,
slowly, slowly, but, as he now knew, surely, had
been stealing into his own heart and killing its
joy. He sprang forward impulsively and threw
his strong young arms about her. 'This is
dreadful,' he said; 'I had no idea you were so
weak. Why didn't you tell me in your letter?'</p>

<p>'I didn't feel quite so weak then,' she said,
drawing herself away with a little smile that
seemed to bring the Lady Elton of Surbiton and
Meerut back again. 'No, no, you impulsive
boy; I am not so feeble as all that. Give me
your arm to steady me. There! I am better
now.'</p>

<p>'Have they taken care of you? Did they
bring you a cup of tea before you came out?
Shall I have one made for you now?'</p>

<p>'No, thank you, dear. The little girl's ayah,
Sumbaten, took every care of me. I don't think
the poor little thing slept at all for fear Grace
and I might want anything. Then, you know,
I have Trixy to look after me. She is a very
good child,' said Lady Elton. She was trying
to speak lightly; but he knew very well that
the effort was almost too great for her.</p>

<p>He followed her lead, saying he was so glad
Trixy had come. They had a little English
society in Gumilcund now, and he did not think
she would find it dull; and was it true that
Captain Liston had come in with them?</p>

<p>'Yes, by the bye,' said Lady Elton. 'It
happened rather conveniently. He had been
sent to Meerut from Delhi; did you hear
how he distinguished himself there? No?
Well, I must leave it to Trixy. The foolish
children are engaged, you know. The General
was obliged to give his consent, though we don't
quite see how they are to live. In the meantime
they are very proud of one another; and of
course Bertie took an additional interest. So
he came with us. I believe he is to join the
army for Lucknow somewhere near this. But
he was to see you and the Resident first.'</p>

<p>'I shall be glad of the opportunity of congratulating
him,' said Tom; 'he is a first-rate
young fellow, and Trixy was always a great friend
of mine.'</p>

<p>As they talked they were walking on quickly,
Lady Elton leaning on his arm. There was a
secluded spot&mdash;a little ferny hollow&mdash;at no great
distance from the pavilion. The blue waters of
the miniature lake lay in front of it, and a little
semi-circle of rocks and boulders, down which
mimic cascades rushed continually, filling the
basins of water in the hollow and keeping moist
and cool the delicate mosses and rare grasses and
ferns that had made it their home, formed a complete
barrier between it and the rest of the garden.</p>

<p>Hither Tom, who could not speak freely
until he was sure of perfect seclusion, guided
Lady Elton's steps. She broke into an exclamation
of surprise and pleasure when he led her
in. 'I've brought you here because it is quiet,'
he said. 'We can talk.'</p>

<p>He placed her in a low chair, under a fairy-leaved
mimosa, drew up a cushion to her feet,
and flung himself down beside her. 'Now,
dearest Lady Elton,' he said, 'have pity upon
me! Tell me about her.'</p>

<p>She was silent for a few moments, looking
down upon him, her pale lips parted in a quivering
smile, and her eyes dim with tears. 'I
was just thinking,' she said, 'that I have not
thanked you yet.'</p>

<p>'Would you thank a man for saving himself?'
he said reproachfully.</p>

<p>She stretched out her hands with a little
plaintive cry. 'Oh, Tom!' she whispered, 'Tom,
my son!'</p>

<p>The words were like a spell. All in a
moment his simulated calmness fled. He sprang
to his feet, and, throwing himself on his knees,
seized the pale, worn hands held out to him,
and pressed them to his lips. 'God bless you!'
he murmured; 'God bless you!'</p>

<p>'But, my dear, you must be quiet,' said the
poor lady. 'There, get up, and let me have my
hands again. Poor boy! poor boy! Do you
care so much?'</p>

<p>'I care more than I can express&mdash;more than
even you can understand. I thought I loved
her then, but now&mdash;&mdash;' and then he pulled up
and looked at her strangely. 'Do you know
everything?' he said. 'Does the General know?
I must explain'&mdash;hurriedly. 'I did not know
myself until the other day. But circumstances
have come to light&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Dear child,' she said softly, 'we have
always known&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'My parentage?'</p>

<p>'We know more about you, I expect, than
you know about yourself.'</p>

<p>'And still&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Sit down here beside me, Tom.' She pushed
back the hair from his forehead and looked
tenderly into his dark eyes. She was thinking
of the past. For the moment the last few
dreadful weeks&mdash;that chasm between the old
life and the new&mdash;were blotted out. He was the
boy he had been then, and she was his mother,
understanding him as no one else did, and thinking
of his friendship with a little motherly glow
of satisfaction and pride.</p>

<p>'I will tell you the whole truth,' she went
on. 'We were on your side&mdash;Grace and I. We
believed we understood you better than the
others; and&mdash;it seems a strange thing to say, but
it is really true&mdash;if you had spoken a little earlier,
you might have won our dear girl then. The
news of your wealth made the General afraid.
You see it was a wonderful change, and these
changes of condition will sometimes show the
character in such different lights. That is what
the General said, at least. Then our dear girl,
who, you know, is sensitive, heard some unkind
and stupid gossip. It was rather about us than
her; but it annoyed her all the more. It is an
old story now,' said Lady Elton, the pink colour
mantling her face, 'and I only tell you because
Grace wished you to know everything. The
silly people said we had known all about it long
ago&mdash;that you would be rich, I mean&mdash;and that
was why we had taken the cottage, and brought
the dear girls next door to you and your mother.
It was absurd, of course; but Grace took fire,
and the General, who, you know, was against it
then, went with her. I argued that he should find
out what our dear girl's own feeling was before
he gave her his advice, for I had my suspicions,
and God knows I would have braved the backbiting
of malicious tongues, if it would have secured
her happiness and yours; but&mdash;well! you know
the General. He would not be the man he is&mdash;one
of the finest soldiers that ever lived&mdash;if he
was not pretty firm in his own opinion. But
what he has seen and heard of you in this dreadful
year, what he knows of you, Tom, has
changed all that. If our dear child&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Why do you hesitate?' said Tom hoarsely.</p>

<p>She paused for a few seconds, as if a wave of
feeling too strong to be controlled had swept
over her, and then she laid her hand gently on
his. 'Will you tell me how it all happened&mdash;exactly?'
she said pleadingly.</p>

<p>'How we found them, do you mean?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>He gave the story clearly and rapidly, from
the moment when he left Gumilcund for Dost Ali
Khan's fort, to that when he saw Grace and Kit
in the hermit's hut, and was assured by Bâl Narîn
that they were alive. He said as little about
himself as he could, and nothing whatever about
his feelings. It was a plain record of facts. The
story over, he stopped. 'Mother,' he said
earnestly, 'I have told you all I can. It is your
turn now. You have seen my darling'&mdash;his
voice broke&mdash;'you who know her so much
better than any of us&mdash;tell me what you
think.'</p>

<p>She turned a little away, and looked up into
the quivering branches of mimosa. A little
striped squirrel was leaping gaily from branch
to branch. Above, in the blue sunlit air, black
and white mynas were darting. Tiny feathered
creatures, bright as living gems, were flashing
hither and thither through the light foliage.
Ah! how peaceful: how happy, they all were!
For a moment she could not speak. Nature,
with her thousand joyous voices, seemed to be
mocking at her pain. In the next moment she
became conscious of those strained-looking,
agonised eyes, and said faintly, 'I hope.'</p>

<p>'Is that <i>all</i> you can say?' asked Tom.</p>

<p>'No!' she cried; 'I have more to tell you,
but give me time!'</p>

<p>He got up, walked to the margin of the lake,
looked down into its waters with eyes that saw
nothing, and then came back and stood beside
her. 'Perhaps,' he said, 'you had rather say
no more just now.'</p>

<p>'No,' she said, 'I must. I promised her. Sit
down again, dear, close beside me, and give me
your hand to hold. I am so foolish, do you
know, that it seems to me sometimes as if all
these dreadful things that have been happening
were a dream, and then I must hold something
not to drift away into confusion. But you are
impatient. I will begin.</p>

<p>'She was not so much surprised to see me as
they thought she would have been. They prepared
her; then we went in together, Trixy and
I, and there was such a beautiful colour in her
face, such a lovely light in her eyes, that I could
scarcely believe what they had told me about
her weakness. All the evening they were busy
looking after us and showing us the palace, and
talking about Gumilcund and you. I thought
my dear child was quieter than the others; but
you know, she had never the same vivacity as
her sisters, so this did not trouble me much.
We all went to rest early. She had begged as
a boon that she and I should be alone together.
I thought she looked at me wistfully before she
laid herself down to rest, but I would not let her
talk, for I was afraid of exciting her. I was so
tired myself and so happy that I fell into a deep
sleep at once. What awoke me I can't tell. It
was as if a spirit had taken me by the hand and
told me to arise. There was a strange pain at my
heart, just as if something was suffering near me,
and I wondered what it meant. But I opened
my eyes and looked round me, and saw the
room flooded with moonlight, and smiled at myself
for my foolish idea. Then I looked across
to where my dear child was lying. She was
awake, her eyes wide open, and&mdash;and&mdash;but I
can't tell you. Oh, God! oh, God! I see it
still&mdash;I shall see it to the end of my days&mdash;that
look in my darling's innocent eyes!'</p>

<p>There was a pause. Tom, who was nearly
beside himself with suspense, pressed her hand
convulsively, tried to speak but could not, and
sat staring out before him into vacancy.</p>

<p>Presently she went on:</p>

<p>'I was at her side in a moment, but at first
she did not know me. I called her by her name,
softly, for fear I should be heard, and began
humming one of the little Indian songs that I
used to lull her with when she was a baby.
How I did it I can't tell, for my heart was like
to break. Little Sumbaten heard us stirring
and crept into the room, and I sent her away to
make tea for us. Gradually the stony look left
my darling's eyes; she recognised me, and we
cried together, and I gave her the tea. Then,
when we were alone again, she crept in beside
me, and hiding her head in my arms, just as she
used to do when she was an infant, told me what
I have promised to tell you.'</p>

<p>She stopped again. It was as if the task she
had undertaken was too hard for her.</p>

<p>Tom looked up at her pitifully. 'You are
torturing yourself without cause,' he said. 'Why
should you tell me? All I wished was that the
burden should be taken from <i>her</i>. She has
spoken to you. It is enough.'</p>

<p>'But I promised; she will ask me,' said poor
Lady Elton. 'Don't look at me so, dear. I
must find a little more strength, and then&mdash;then&mdash;we
shall rest, my dear child and I.</p>

<p>'You know how she left the fort; but you
may not know that the wicked Soubahdar who
took her away had a grudge against her father.
I must try to tell you about him. He was a
man I had always disliked, he was so smooth in
his manners&mdash;not a common man at all. He had
been educated well, and he had lived for many
years with Englishmen, so that he knew what
our ideas and feelings are. The General had
treated him not only as a comrade but as a
friend. They had shared the same tent; he
knew that honour was dearer to him than life;
and he meant&mdash;I can see it all now&mdash;to humiliate
and punish him through her, our darling. When
I think of it, Tom, when I think of it, I feel the
blood curdling about my heart. But I must
not&mdash;&mdash;They left the fort together, this man,
Grace, and the child. Grace soon found out
that he was her enemy. But for Kit I think
she would have killed herself, for she carried
poison about with her; but she dared not take
him with her and she could not leave him behind.
Day after day they went on, travelling
by unfrequented ways. In the villages through
which they passed they were often subject to
insult. He would bring crowds to stare at them,
and they would tell her, exulting like fiends,
about the massacres and outrages in the English
stations. But here and there her gentleness
won for them kind looks and words of pity. So
they went on till a certain day when poor little
Kit, who was nearly worn out, stumbled in the
way and said he could go no further. The
brute struck him with a whip; Grace caught
him in her arms with indignant words. Then
the Soubahdar looked at her; it was only a look,
but she knew very well what it meant&mdash;for Kit
murder, for herself worse. What power held his
hand it is impossible to say. There was nothing
to keep him from striking, but he did not.
They went on until late, Grace half-leading,
half-carrying Kit. She says that with that look
a new spirit and strength seemed to have entered
into her. They came to a little village by a
river. She and Kit were given a mud hut to
spend the night in. She put the child to sleep,
but she would not sleep herself. Towards
nightfall the Soubahdar came in; he had been
drinking heavily. She feigned to be asleep, and
he leant over her, muttering awful words of what
he would do the next day. She kept her
presence of mind; she says she never felt in the
least danger of losing it. Then he threw off his
weapons, the long knife and revolver he always
wore, fell down like a log, and was fast asleep
in two instants. I tell you all as she told it to
me,' said poor Lady Elton, 'and indeed, indeed,
I seem to see it now. It is passing before me
like a nightmare.'</p>

<p>'God help you to forget,' said Tom fervently.</p>

<p>'Yes; but I must tell it first&mdash;all&mdash;all!</p>

<p>'My dear child made sure that he was asleep.
Can't you see her&mdash;I can&mdash;listening, staring out
into that dark place. If he had stirred she was
lost. But he did not. She was not afraid, she
says. All her womanly timidity had gone.
Whatever was to be done&mdash;and I don't think
even then she knew&mdash;she was ready. She got
up and took careful note of everything. The
hut had two doors: one looked towards the
river, which was very deep and dark, and flowed
close by. It was open, and partly blocked up by
the Soubahdar, who had fallen half in and half
out of the hut, with his feet towards the river.
The other door looked out on the village. She
opened it, and saw that the hut they occupied
was at a little distance from the others, which
were all perfectly still and dark. Then she
closed it, fastening the latch with a piece of
wire which she found on the floor. Kit was in
his first sweet sleep. She crouched down beside
him for a few moments to think. They might
run away, but he would be sure to find them,
and then their death&mdash;Kit's death&mdash;would be
certain. There was only one way to be rid of
him. As she was thinking, his wicked words
came back to her, and she saw the awful look
again. At the same moment Kit gave a little
sobbing cry, and called out to her through his
sleep. It was that, I verily believe, that gave
my darling strength. Softly, as I can well
imagine, she soothed him off to sleep again.
Then she rose from her knees and went to where
the Soubahdar lay, stupid and senseless in his
drunken sleep. His long knife was beside him.
She drew it out of its sheath, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'She killed him!' hissed Tom from between
his closed teeth. 'My brave little girl! My
heroine!'</p>

<p>'She killed him!' echoed Lady Elton.
'Think of it, with those little slender hands!
She did more; she dragged him across the
little space of ground that divided them from
the river. How she found strength for it God
only knows. But before she knew, before she
had recovered from the state of frenzy into
which his threats had thrown her, she heard a
heavy plunge, saw the dark waters part, and
knew that her terror slept. All this time Kit
was asleep. When it was over she awoke him,
whispered that they had a chance of escape,
tore him out of the hut so that he should see
no traces of what had happened, and before the
dawn of the next day had broken they two
were far away from the village. You know
the rest,' said Lady Elton wearily.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Tom, 'I know the rest. My
poor darling! My poor darling! Is it this
that has been troubling her?'</p>

<p>'I am afraid it will never cease to trouble
her,' said Lady Elton very sadly. 'If it had
happened to anyone else! But Grace! Oh,
can't you see&mdash;I can&mdash;how the gentleness, the
tender womanhood, that are her very self, have
been wounded&mdash;how everything in her, her
whole nature, has suffered outrage?'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes! I see&mdash;I see too well! But,
dearest Lady Elton, those are the wounds that
time heals,' cried Tom. 'She has spoken: that
is the great point. Don't ask me to despond;
I can't. You will comfort her. Troubled!
why she should rejoice&mdash;exult! The man she
destroyed was a scourge to humanity. He was
no man: he was a monster. Who knows how
many murders he had committed, how many
more were being planned by his evil mind?
She was an instrument in the hands of God for
dealing out to him the punishment he so richly
deserved. My only sorrow is that no man was
near to save her little hand&mdash;' For a moment
his voice was choked with sobs; then he looked
up, and there was a light, soft and wonderful,
in his dark eyes. 'But you will tell her all
this,' he said. 'You will tell her that there is
no true man living who would not weep as I do
that she should have had to deal the blow
herself&mdash;who would not honour her from his
inmost soul for her courage and devotion.
Yes'&mdash;smiling&mdash;'I have no fear now. You will
heal her; you will bring her back to us!'</p>

<p>'I will at least try,' said Lady Elton sadly.
'Our darling is in the hands of God.'</p>

<p>There was a depression, a weariness, in her
voice which could not be mistaken, and, in fact,
the telling of the story had been almost more
than she could bear. In a moment Tom was on
his feet.</p>

<p>'What a selfish idiot I am!' he cried,
'allowing you to exhaust yourself after this
fashion. Come; I can't let you speak another
word. Trixy will be looking for you, too.
She will think we have spirited you away.'</p>

<p>'Ah, poor Trixy!' said Lady Elton, smiling
through her tears. 'She is a little bit of a
heroine, too. But she is differently constituted
from Grace. She exults over her share in our
little skirmish.'</p>

<p>And so, speaking lightly to hide the deep
feeling that had almost overpowered them, they
left the ferny hollow where the strange story
had been told, and made their way slowly
through the beautiful garden, radiant now with
morning sunlight, to the ladies' pavilion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Touching and tender beyond expression was
the first meeting between Grace and Tom after
he had seen her mother and heard the wild tale
she had to tell.</p>

<p>It did not come about until the evening of
that day. 'We must let her rest,' Lady Elton
had said, and he agreed. But, when the daylight
had fallen, he found his way to the door
of the pretty little room that had been allotted
to them. Aglaia saw him, ran in to tell Lady
Elton, and then ran away again.</p>

<p>Grace was lying on the sofa, her pale gold
hair spread about her like a cloud, white and
weak, but with a look of dawning hope on her
face that made her poor mother's heart tremble
with joy.</p>

<p>'Tom is here,' she whispered, bending over
her. 'May he come in?'</p>

<p>Her eyes gave the consent that her voice
had scarcely strength to frame. Lady Elton
went out and told Tom that he might go in,
warning him, at the same time, that she was
weak and that he must not stay too long.</p>

<p>In the next instant these two were looking
one at the other silently, a strange, new consciousness
between them. It was only an instant;
but in that instant he took in all the details
of the scene: the long, slender figure, in its
white draperies, brought out into almost startling
relief by the gorgeously embroidered cushions
and shawls that lay about it: the pale, beautiful
face, pure as an angel's, looking out wistfully
from its shadowy cloud of hair: the sweet
eyes, into which, for all these days, he had
scarcely dared to look, for fear of seeing in
them the horror, the spiritual fear, that, when
he met it, almost maddened him&mdash;eyes, so
gentle, now, with half dropped lids that veiled
their childlike joy and wonder.</p>

<p>While he paused, spellbound, she smiled and
tried to rise, a movement that at once awoke
him from his trance.</p>

<p>'Don't! don't!' he cried. 'You mustn't.'</p>

<p>He rushed forward, flung himself on his
knees beside the couch, and, with a look of
infinite yearning, held out his arms. For a
moment she drew back; in the next his love
had conquered. He held her in his arms, her
head upon his breast, her heart beating against
his. It is a moment that will live with him as
long as his pulses beat, and his eyes behold the
sun. He was so happy that he scarcely knew
what he did. All his young love and pity and
devotion, all the pent-up torrent of agonised
tenderness that, for these many days, had been
surging about his heart, seemed suddenly to
leap to the surface. Murmuring passionate,
indistinguishable words, he rained kisses on her
cheeks and lips and brow. She was his&mdash;his;
and he vowed, by all that was sacred, that
neither men nor demons should part them again.
He would hold her&mdash;he would hold her&mdash;against
the world! So, for a few moments, he
raved.</p>

<p>Suddenly he stopped. She had drawn
herself gently away from him, and he saw that
her face was pale, and that her lips were
quivering like a tired child's. Then, with a
swift remorse, he entreated her pardon for his
impulsiveness, and laid her head back tenderly
against the pillows.</p>

<p>'Forgive me, dearest,' he said. 'It was the
first delight. I have been so patient all these
days; and you know'&mdash;bending over her with
a radiant smile&mdash;'our feelings will not always
keep within bounds. But I promise to be very
quiet now, if I may stay a few moments.
May I?'</p>

<p>'Yes; but you must sit down and be
reasonable,' said Grace.</p>

<p>'Darling, I have never been anything but
reasonable. And to-day above all days! Till
I had seen your mother, till I knew what she
and your father wished, I had made up my
mind to say nothing. And you know, dearest,
how well I have kept my resolution. Oh!
don't you think it has been torture to see you,
day by day, as I have done, to know what I
know, and not to throw myself before you, and
tell you plainly of my love and reverence?'</p>

<p>'Hush, Tom, hush!' said Grace, tears
filling her eyes. 'You make too much of me.
I am only a poor weak girl.'</p>

<p>'You are my queen, Grace, my angel, my
wife!'</p>

<p>She opened her lips as if to answer; but he
would not listen. 'No,' he said, 'not a word.
A little "Yes," if you like. If you try to say
anything else, Grace, I will seal your lips with
kisses.'</p>

<p>He drew a chair beside her, and sat down.</p>

<p>'See how reasonable I am,' he said. 'Give me
your hand to hold, so that I may know it is no
dream, and we will talk about the future.'</p>

<p>'My beloved,' she said softly, looking at
him with wistful tenderness, 'let the future
care for itself! We have the present&mdash;the
moment that is passing now. God in His
mercy has given us that.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Tom, 'the loveliest moment that
earth will ever give us, Grace&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>At this moment Lady Elton, who had been
feeling a little uneasy, looked in.</p>

<p>'Haven't you talked long enough, children?'
she said.</p>

<p>'I don't know about Grace; but I don't
think I could talk long enough,' said Tom.
And then he jumped up, like the boy he was,
and threw his arms round Lady Elton's neck.</p>

<p>'Wish us joy, little mother!' he whispered.
'I have proposed, and she hasn't said "No."'</p>

<p>'Oh! Tom,' she cried, divided between
tears and laughter, 'what a baby you are!'</p>

<p>'Am I? Then I am afraid I shall be a baby
to the end of the chapter. I have never been
so happy in my life.'</p>

<p>'God send you happiness always, dear,' she
whispered. 'But your mother, have you thought
of her?'</p>

<p>'Mother! it was the dearest desire of her
heart that Grace and I should come together,'
cried Tom. 'This will be the most delightful
news to her. We must all go home together
when the troubles here are over, and I can leave
my post. Then, perhaps, you and I will persuade
mother to come out with us for a cold
season.'</p>

<p>'Ah! you are running far ahead,' said Lady
Elton, sighing. 'However&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'There is no reason why I shouldn't&mdash;isn't
that what you meant to say?' interrupted Tom.</p>

<p>'What I meant to say and what I must say is,
that they are waiting for you in the hall.'</p>

<p>'Very polite of them; but quite useless,'
said Tom with a little laugh. 'I'm not cowardly
as a general rule; but I really couldn't face
them to-night. I shall have something to eat in
my own quarters. Goodnight, little mother.'
Then to Grace: 'Darling, you will <i>promise</i> me to
sleep well.'</p>

<p>'I will do my very best,' she answered,
smiling.</p>

<p>He left the room by a door that opened on
to one of the passages, for he did not wish to
pass through the hall. Grace listened silently,
until the echo of his footsteps had died away,
and then, to her mother's distress, she turned her
face to the wall and wept.</p>

<h5><a name="CHAPTER_LII" id="CHAPTER_LII">CHAPTER LII</a></h5>

<h4>GIFTS AND CONGRATULATIONS</h4>


<p>When it became known in the palace that
Grace and the rajah were formally betrothed,
there was a joyful little tumult of excitement
and delight. Lady Elton, who gave her piece
of news in the hall after dinner, was surrounded
and congratulated, and laughed at, and cried
over in turns; and it was only with the greatest
difficulty that she could prevent the little society
from rushing in a body into Grace's room, and
overwhelming her with the congratulations,
which she was scarcely strong enough to receive.</p>

<p>The next morning all sorts of delightful
rumours were afloat. Hoosanee had been met
in one of the corridors carrying a basket of the
loveliest white flowers that ever were seen, the
rajah's morning greeting to his bride-that-was-to-be.
Sumbaten, who was as much excited as
anyone else, brought in word of having seen the
rajah riding Snow-queen at break-neck speed&mdash;an
outlet, the ladies said, to his excited feeling.
They smiled one to another as they remarked
that he was charmingly young, and would make
a most amusing lover. But, in fact&mdash;it was Lucy,
I think, who made this observation&mdash;they were
all in love with him themselves; and if Grace
hadn't been such a darling as well as a heroine,
they could not have allowed her to appropriate
him. It was true, indeed, that she was the only
unappropriated lady in the palace; but this was
a minor detail, and not worthy of being
mentioned.</p>

<p>Some one had heard, heaven alone knows
how, that the ceremony was to be performed
according to the rites of the Church of England,
and that a clergyman had been already sent for
from Agra or Meerut, upon whose arrival it
would immediately take place. Mrs. Lyster
suggested that they should find out how Grace
was before they disposed of her so summarily;
but she found everyone firmly convinced that,
being engaged, she would very soon be quite
well. In confirmation of this benignant prophecy,
cases without number were quoted.
'Ah!' said Mrs. Durant fervently, 'happiness
is a great tonic! Think of how miserably ill
I was before my darling Kit came.'</p>

<p>'We were all ill,' said Lucy. 'I was afraid
to go to sleep at night for the dreadful dreams I
had. Now I sleep like a top.'</p>

<p>There was another little person present who
had pronounced views as to the tonic quality of
happiness; but she was too much preoccupied
at the moment to be able to enter into the
discussion. Certain sounds, indistinguishable
probably to the other members of the talkative
little group, had fallen upon her ears. With a
vague remark about seeing how Grace was, she
left the summer-house. When in the avenue
she stood, for a few moments, shading her eyes
with her hand; then, smiling to herself, and
looking very pretty in the process, she put on
the broad-brimmed hat she was swinging in her
hand, and turned down a narrow walk fringed
with grassy borders and light-leaved acacias.</p>

<p>The sounds, which proceeded from a rich
baritone voice singing in a subdued key one of
the sentimental English love ditties, that were
in vogue at the time, drew nearer. The girl in
the straw hat stopped to listen, and there was
a mischievous expression in her brown eyes.
Then, quick as thought, she darted behind one
of the trees. Presently a form followed the
voice. It was that of an English cavalry officer
in full uniform, with clanking sword and spurs&mdash;a
tall spare young fellow, whose comely face,
burnt brown and red by the sun, and lit by a
pair of merry blue eyes, was about as pleasant
a sight as it would be possible to look upon.
This girl at least found it so, for her face was as
red as summer roses, and her eyes were dancing
with laughter. He, meanwhile, was looking out
before him doubtfully. Seeing no one, he drew
out his watch.</p>

<p>'I am sure of the path,' he said half-aloud,
'for I counted the turnings. Can I be early?
No, I'm late.'</p>

<p>After another long and fruitless look, which
penetrated to the very end of the path, he was
turning away with a disappointed sigh, when
the wild little creature behind the trees darted
out upon him. 'Now Trixy!' he said reproachfully,
but he caught both of her hands and held
them fast.</p>

<p>She looked up at him audaciously, mimicking
him. 'I counted the turnings. Can I be
late?'</p>

<p>'Trixy, do you know that it is very naughty
to play the eavesdropper? And what if I told
you that I knew you were there the whole
time?'</p>

<p>'You didn't, Bertie,' she said, blushing. 'I
certainly shouldn't believe you did if you
assured me of it till to-morrow morning. But
don't; it would be monotonous. Besides, I have
something to tell you&mdash;a great piece of news, a
delightful piece of news.' She had linked her
arm in his, and he was looking down upon her
with an expression of love and admiration that
made his frank face and blue eyes beautiful.
As for Trixy, she would not for worlds have
given utterance to her thoughts, which were
irresistibly detained now and then by the vision
of her own extraordinary good fortune.</p>

<p>'Can you guess?' she said, looking down
that he might not see how her eyes were
dancing.</p>

<p>'More arrivals?' he hazarded.</p>

<p>'No, no, guess again.'</p>

<p>'Has the rajah had news from the front?' he
cried breathlessly.</p>

<p>'I haven't seen his Excellency yet,' said
Trixy drily; 'but I believe he is to honour us
with his company at breakfast, which is served
in a place like a Greek temple. No, Mr. Bertie,
my news is much, much more exciting. Do
you give it up? Then I must tell you. Tom
and our darling Grace are engaged.'</p>

<p>'Weren't they long ago?' said Bertie, looking
puzzled.</p>

<p>'Weren't they long ago?' echoed Trixy.
'Do you know, Bertie, you can be a most
uninteresting companion. I thought you would
at least be pleased.'</p>

<p>'Why, so I am, Trixy. <i>If</i> they only made
up their minds yesterday&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'But don't you see? Can't you understand?
They are formally engaged. Tom acted like a
gallant gentleman. He wouldn't say a word
till mother came.'</p>

<p>'Oh! that's it, is it?' said Bertie, smiling
indulgently. 'And now I suppose you are all
in a delightful ferment. Love and lovers, wedding
frocks and wedding favours&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'We are not cynics,' said Trixy loftily. 'I
know somebody who used to take a little interest
in such things himself. Now, I suppose,
when he has convoys, and important matters
of that description to look after, he disdains
frivolities.'</p>

<p>'If he could disdain them as delightfully as
a little friend of his, Trixy, he might have some
chance of earning a reputation for solidity.'</p>

<p>'Bravo, Bertie! I call that a well-balanced
sentence. But, seriously, are you not glad?'</p>

<p>'I am very glad, Trixy, especially as his
Excellency and I will be brothers. Perhaps he
may show his fraternal feelings by giving us a
lift up. I believe he could do anything he liked
with our Government just now. Do you know,
little Miss Mocker, that he is one of the most
distinguished persons in India at the present
moment?'</p>

<p>'I have heard other people say so,' said
Trixy with some dignity. 'However, that doesn't
matter much. The interesting part of it is that
he is engaged to Grace.'</p>

<p>'And Grace is better?' asked Bertie.</p>

<p>'Ah! that is just it,' said Trixy, her eyes
filling with tears. 'I may be a little goose&mdash;they
all tell me I am; but there is something in
Grace's face that troubles me.'</p>

<p>'She has had some terrible experiences,' said
Bertie, shuddering, as he remembered his day
and night at Dost Ali Khan's fort.</p>

<p>'I think they must have been worse than
any of us imagine,' whispered Trixy. 'She told
mother something the night before last. I asked
mother to tell me; but she wouldn't, and there
has been a scared look in her face ever since.'</p>

<p>'The rajah has a wonderful story to tell,' said
Bertie. 'I was with him yesterday evening, you
know. I believe he couldn't face the ladies.'</p>

<p>'And he told you he was engaged?'</p>

<p>'No: he didn't. He left me to infer it. I
suppose, from what you say, that it was too near
a bliss to be talked about,' said Bertie, smiling.
'And I think he was anxious and troubled.
But I drew him on to tell me of his adventures
and your sister's, and I think it did him good.
I met him, you know, when he was in the depths,
clue lost, and almost in despair, but pushing on
with a plucky disregard of consequences that
made us put him down as mad.'</p>

<p>'God bless him! He is a noble fellow,
though he <i>is</i> a rajah and an Excellency!' burst
out Trixy. 'Grace ought to get better. She
<i>must</i>.'</p>

<p>'If she can, Trixy.'</p>

<p>'Oh! she can! she can! I felt like that
after my wound. I was so weak and miserable,
and everything was so wretched that I thought
it would be better to die and be done with it all.
Then you came in, my poor boy! and there was
such a troubled look in your face. I couldn't
bear it. You seemed to be asking me all the
time not to give way. And so, one day I set
my teeth together, and clenched my fists, and
said to myself, "You are a selfish little fool!
You shall get better, you <i>shall</i>." In two days I
was on my feet, Bertie, and then&mdash;' in a lower
voice, and looking up at him with dewy eyes&mdash;'Happiness
came and cured me!'</p>

<p>The next words, which were chiefly of protest,
were inaudible. Bertie had caught her in
his arms and was covering her face with kisses.</p>

<p>'If you behave like that,' she said severely,
when he had released her, 'I shall never tell you
my experiences again. Look at my hair! And
when I am just going to take breakfast with his
Excellency. No sir! keep your distance, if you
please; I can set it right myself.'</p>

<p>'God grant,' said Bertie fervently, 'that your
experience may be your sister's!'</p>

<p>'She will have a much better-behaved lover,'
said Trixy; '<i>Tom</i> has some spirit of reverence
and romance. He will fall on one knee and kiss
the tips of her fingers.'</p>

<p>'Will he?' said Bertie, with fine scorn. 'I
should just like to lay a wager with you&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'So should I; but there would be certain
difficulties,' said Trixy demurely. 'Who would
hold the stakes, and who would be umpire?'
This last mocking question brought them in
full view of the garden pavilion.</p>

<p>The rajah, looking a little shame-faced, it
must be confessed, but otherwise very much his
ordinary self, had joined the party of ladies, who
were all congratulating him, each in her own
characteristic way. Lucy dropped a deep
curtsey and said that she had never supposed
she would live to be a ranee's first cousin. She
felt at least two inches taller. Mrs. Lyster,
whose kind eyes shone brightly through quick
tears, caught him by both hands and wished
him all the happiness that even heaven itself
could send. Kit came forward with a little
manly stride that set them all laughing; said he
was very glad; hoped they would make haste;
but he and 'Billy' weren't at all surprised, they
had known it all the time. Mrs. Durant shook
her head, and begged the rajah to excuse him.
The fact was everyone was spoiling Kit. Then
the little Aglaia, her face flushed to a beautiful
red, stood up before him, and kissed his hand.</p>

<p>'I love Grace almost as much as I love you
now,' she said, in her sweet girlish treble, 'and,
oh! may I stay with her?'</p>

<p>'Of course you shall, darling,' said Tom,
stooping to kiss the little shining face. Was it
a dream&mdash;a strange illusion? He looked up,
smiling at himself for his folly; but it was with
him still. He had seen, or fancied he had seen,
Grace's expression in the pretty child's eyes.</p>

<p>At this moment, to the surprise and delight
of everyone, Grace herself came in. She was
leaning on her mother's arm, and Bertie Liston,
who, standing at the door of the pavilion, and
debating with himself whether he should go in,
had caught sight of them and rushed to their
assistance, was helping to support her. Grace
looked pale and weak; but they thought there
was a new brightness in her eyes, a new vigour
in her voice.</p>

<p>As for Tom, no human being could have
been happier or more brilliantly triumphant
than he was that morning. Bertie had, of course,
at once given up to him his place by Grace's
side, and he led her to the table with a gentleness
and reverence that amused and touched
them all. He was quite as enchanting a lover
as they had expected to find him; while the
beauty and dignity of his appearance had never
been so marked as now.</p>

<p>After breakfast he insisted that Grace should
rest, impressing upon Lady Elton that they must
not let her do too much. Then he went to his
own business, which consisted principally in
letting his intentions be known in the city, and
consulting Chunder Singh and others as to the
arrangements he should make to celebrate his
marriage, and assure his wife a fitting position.
He wrote also to his mother, and Mr. Cherry,
and General Elton. This over, there came the
usual work in court, after which one or two of
the principal citizens waited upon him and
begged his permission to present themselves at
the palace with their congratulations and offerings.</p>

<p>He thanked them heartily, assured them that
the palace would be open, and went off to consult
Lady Elton about whether Grace could be
present at a reception in the early evening.</p>

<p>Grace, who had been resting all the morning,
sent back word that nothing would please her
better than to see all who cared to come. So
they carried her down into the hall, and while
the daylight was fading, and the lovely golden
hues of evening were winning their way through
the marble lattices, she lay in the midst of her
friends, receiving the visits of Indians of every
degree, and thanking them, in gracious, gentle
words, for the welcome they had given her.</p>

<p>None came without his gift&mdash;small gifts of
fruit and flowers and sweetmeats, and larger
gifts of jewels and rich caskets, and costly robes
and embroidered stuffs and perfumes; and as
she lay amongst them, her pale thin fingers
straying from one to another, she looked, Trixy
said laughingly, like a fairy-princess in a rainbow
bower.</p>

<p>This day was a sample of several others.
Those who could not be admitted the first day
came the second and the third. Everyone was
anxious to see for himself the gracious, beautiful
lady, of whom such wonderful tales were told.
Everyone desired to give some token, however
small, of his reverence and affection for Byrajee
Pirtha Raj, their ruler, who had returned to
them in the person of his son. Grace received
presents enough those three days to constitute
in themselves a rich dower.</p>

<p>There was one, however, whom she expected
daily, but who did not appear&mdash;Vishnugupta,
the priest. At last she made inquiries about
him. 'Is it because so many people are coming
and going that Vishnugupta keeps away?' she
said to Tom one day.</p>

<p>'I expect so; but I will ask about him,' he
answered.</p>

<p>There were several Indians in the hall. He
turned to one, who stood close by, and asked
him if the priest had been seen lately about the
city.</p>

<p>The man bowed his head low and covered
his face.</p>

<p>'The holy man has gone,' he said.</p>

<p>'To his hermitage in the hills, I suppose?'
said the rajah.</p>

<p>'No, Excellency, beyond.'</p>

<p>'What! has Vishnugupta other haunts?'</p>

<p>But here Grace touched his arm; and, turning,
he saw a strange, indescribable yearning in
her face.</p>

<p>'He is dead,' she said. 'I thought so.'</p>

<p>The man of whom they had been inquiring
bent his head silently. He had not wished that
his should be the voice to speak the word of
ill omen; but it had been spoken and he could
not deny it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Grace said nothing more about Vishnugupta
that night, but the next day she asked Tom to
find out for her how he had died. There was
little or nothing to know. After his last conversation
with Grace he had started, as it was supposed,
for his hermitage in the hills. Some had
seen, or imagined, a change in his face&mdash;a rapt
expression that had awed and solemnised them;
but no one had spoken to him. The morning
after the day he left the city he was found in a
mango-tope at a short distance from the gates,
his back against a tree&mdash;dead! His face, which,
those who found him said, was turned towards
the sun rising, had lost the tense and feverish
look which it had worn so often in his lifetime.
It was irradiated with the morning light, and a
stillness&mdash;an expression of satisfied longing&mdash;seemed
to rest upon it. This was what Tom
heard and what he told Grace. She listened
with a wistful smile. 'A beautiful death,' she
said softly; 'I am glad for him.'</p>

<p>'He was an aged man. His death was
natural,' said Tom with unusual eagerness.</p>

<p>'Death is always natural,' answered Grace,
and she added after a moment's pause: 'What
we call death. Isn't it wonderful, Tom, the
power words have to mislead us? We think of
death with horror; it is the word, the associations.
If we were to look at it calmly, as it
is&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Death means separation, Grace,' interrupted
her lover hoarsely. 'To those who go it may
mean everything you imagine. To those who
are left&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>He broke down, for his own words seemed
to choke him. With a force that had in it
indescribable pain, Mrs. Lyster's phrase, spoken
after his darling's first talk with Vishnugupta,
came back to him: 'On the other side.' He
rose hastily and looked down upon her with a
piteous effort to smile. 'But why should we
discuss these dismal topics, darling?' he said.
'Try to look a little less like an angel and I
will tell you what I have been doing about our
marriage.'</p>

<p>Thereupon he plunged into a long and not
altogether new recapitulation of the arrangements
that were being made for that glorious
event, of the congratulations that were pouring
in, and of his own plans, which grew more
golden every day, for the wonderful life, radiating
happiness upon all who came within the
sphere of its influence, that they were to lead
together. Generally these talks with Grace gave
him fresh hope and courage, but to-day he left
her, he knew not why, with a heavy heart.</p>

<h5><a name="CHAPTER_LIII" id="CHAPTER_LIII">CHAPTER LIII</a></h5>

<h4>NEWS FROM LUCKNOW: TRIXY'S DETERMINATION</h4>


<p>For the next few weeks, however, there was
little change. The household in the palace
dropped once more into a regular mode of living.
Lady Elton fell into her place at once. Anxious
as she continued to be about Grace, her sympathy
and gentleness made her the friend and adviser
of everyone else. They called her smilingly
'the mother of the zenana.' From Trixy, who
would persist in looking upon the bright side of
everything, there emanated a spirit of courage
and joyous animation that was as refreshing as
the morning breeze in the desert. Captain
Liston, who was presently to lead out a convoy
of provisions and ammunition to meet Sir Colin
Campbell on his march up country, became
exceedingly popular both in the palace and in
the city. Kit, whose smart figure in its semi-oriental
dress was, by this time, a familiar sight
in the streets and market-places of Gumilcund,
followed Bertie about like his shadow, and
proved a most efficient guide. The readiness,
aplomb, and curious air of distinction that
characterised the child, made him particularly
attractive to the Asiatic multitude, so that he
knew every nook and corner of the city, and
was on the best of terms with everyone. To
display his knowledge before so fine and complaisant
a person as Bertie Liston was thoroughly
agreeable to Kit, while the defection of Aglaia,
who could scarcely ever be persuaded now to
leave Grace, made the new companionship all
the more delightful to him.</p>

<p>Lucy's parents being shut up in the Lucknow
Residency, with the heroic survivors of that
unparalleled defence, while her husband and
Colonel Durant were with Sir Colin Campbell,
much anxiety was felt as to the progress of the
army and their efficiency to carry to a successful
issue the great work committed to them. But
though often troubled and depressed about their
own individual friends, not one of this little
company entertained any doubts as to the final
result. England was bound to triumph. The
slaughterers of women and children must bite
the dust.</p>

<p>The first great event after Lady Elton's
arrival was the departure of Bertie for the
front. He went off in the highest spirits,
promising all sorts of glorious performances,
with letters and messages as often as he could
find hands to carry them.</p>

<p>Trixy, of whom he used to say sometimes
that she was game to the very finger-tips, saw
him go away as if he were going to a party of
pleasure. From the horse, on which she had
ridden out, by the rajah's side, to see the convoy
start, she waved her young hero a gallant farewell;
and then, turning away, put her horse into
a mad canter to deaden the pain at her heart.
Yet the next day she seemed almost as joyous as
ever. And indeed she was not unhappy. Awful
qualms of heart would come over her at
moments, and a spirit of mad rebellion against
the world and things in general for such horrors
as were being allowed in their economy, would
seize and shake her. But actually her profound
belief in her own and Bertie's good star prevented
her from being orthodoxly miserable.
Bertie gone, her attention was more fully concentrated
upon Grace, with whom, as the days
wore on, she began to feel a little impatient.
When they were together she managed to control
herself; but, now and then, she would let herself
out to her mother. 'Grace ought to get better,'
she would say. 'What is there to prevent her?
It is too bad. That poor fellow looks gloomier
and gloomier every day!'</p>

<p>It was useless for Lady Elton to argue that
health and sickness are not in our own hands,
or to point out that Grace was making every
possible effort; Trixy would still insist: 'If there
is nothing really wrong, she ought to begin to
be more like other people. If there is, she
should see a doctor. I could never give up
without a fight,' said Trixy, setting her teeth
together.</p>

<p>Then, with tears in her eyes, Lady Elton
would turn away. It was true, too true! Grace
was slipping away from them. It was not her
own fault. Her mother knew this well. Honestly,
loyally, she strove to shake off her invalid ways,
to be amongst them, to belong to them. But,
alas! with every day the failure became more
apparent. She was like a broken flower that
not even the sunshine can revive. Something
within her had snapped. The spirit of vitality
that conquers pain and weakness, that God-implanted
love of the dear Earth and all her
homely ways, which will so often bring a sick
soul back from the brink of the grave, had gone
never to return, even at the bidding of human
love, with all its passionate sweetness.</p>

<p>Now and then, after a sleepless night, the
strain which she put on herself would, for a
moment, be relaxed, and then those who loved
her best would see a strange hunger in her eyes.
It was as if she was holding out her hands to
them and imploring them to let her go.</p>

<p>One morning Tom saw, or fancied he saw,
this in her eyes. They were alone, for Aglaia,
Grace's constant companion, after looking up
pleadingly into the rajah's face and receiving
no responsive smile, had slipped away. He
flung himself on his knees by the couch, and
catching her hands, which were as soft as snow,
and only a little warmer, gazed speechlessly into
her eyes. 'What is it, dear?' she said faintly.</p>

<p>'Grace,' he cried, 'what do you want?
where are you going? what do you see? oh,
God! what do you see&mdash;that you should wish
to leave us?'</p>

<p>An expression of pain and perplexity crossed
her face. 'Wish?' she echoed as if she had
not understood the word.</p>

<p>He laid his burning face on her hands.
'Darling,' he said humbly, 'is there anything
we can do&mdash;anything we can give you? I would
give my life, Grace, all I have and am, for you.'</p>

<p>But still she looked at him dreamily; and
then all at once the futility of his prayers came
home to him, and with a sob, which he could
not repress, he rose slowly to his feet. Fool!
Will even a child be drawn from its home by
bribes and kisses? It was her <i>home</i>, the vision
sweet and awful of the Divine, that was beckoning
to her, and he was trying, by his poor love,
to hold her to the little joys and sorrows of
life.</p>

<p>But reason as he would with himself, his
heart was sore. Like Trixy, he could not give
up without a fight, and, on the evening of that
day, he sent for a doctor. His messengers
travelled night and day. The doctor, a civilian
of some experience, who had come out a year
or two before, to make his fortune, lost no time.
A week after the message had been despatched
he was lodged in the palace.</p>

<p>He saw Grace, and was puzzled as men of
his profession generally are by what seem like
abnormal ailments. Who has any right to be
ill, except by rule of thumb? Pushed into a
corner, he spoke vaguely of mental shock,
recommended quiet, which she had been having,
Tom said despairingly, for weeks, and set
himself to watch and take notes. Alas! the
notes did not help him much. When he had
been in close attendance upon her for a week he
was further from that full understanding of her
case, which, he had said, would enable him to
deal with it satisfactorily, than he had been at
the beginning.</p>

<p>And yet she was patient and perfectly submissive,
taking everything he prescribed and
never refusing to answer his questions.</p>

<p>So the days wore on. October passed away
and November opened. It was such a
November as has scarcely ever been seen even
in Gumilcund. The burning heat of the
summer and early autumn were over, and
the glory and brightness of the Indian
winter, the deep skies, the sunny days, the
entrancing mornings and evenings had begun
to be felt. The garden, with its overspreading
foliage, its wildernesses of flowers, crimson and
purple and orange; its arbours, covered with
azure-blue convolvulus and lilac Bougainvillea,
and its long avenues bordered with channels
of flowing water, was in perfection. It was a
happiness to explore it, a bliss to breathe its
air. If anything could heal Grace, so they
said to one another, it would surely be the
beauty of this Indian winter. By the doctor's
advice she spent her life in the open air. A
wonderful couch and carriage in one had been
designed, for her by the rajah, and skilfully
executed by some of the clever Gumilcund
mechanics. In this she was wheeled from place
to place, making new and delightful discoveries
every day. To those who watched her it
would seem that, for days, her life was nothing
more than a dream. But there were moments
still when she was stirred up to a strong
interest in life.</p>

<p>Such a moment was that when news came
to Gumilcund of the final relief of the Lucknow
Residency.</p>

<p>It arrived late in the evening. None of the
ladies in the palace will ever forget that day.
They were together in a little grove by the
lake. They had been having tea out of
the jewelled cups, which with other lovely
things Tom had hunted out of his father's
treasury to tempt Grace to eat and drink.
After tea, Trixy, who, expecting news, had
been in a state of irrepressible excitement for
several days, seized upon the tiny boat, rocking
in front of them, spun it out into the lake, and
tried to quiet herself by pouring out some of
her favourite songs. Those in the grove
listened silently. They had been talking, trying
to amuse one another and forget the intolerable
ache of suspense. When Trixy's clear young
voice came thrilling out on the evening air they
all felt thankful for an excuse to be quiet.</p>

<p>A pretty group they made under the quivering
light and shade of the acacias; Grace, on her
long couch, her hands and face almost transparent
now, but beautiful still, with a seraphic
unearthly loveliness that can scarcely be put
into words; and near her sweet Lady Elton,
with Aglaia at her feet; then Kit, who had
been a little sombre since Bertie left, leaning
against his mother, half asleep, she with her
arm round him, an expression of peace on
her thin, worn face; in the centre of the
group Lucy, robed in the white cashmere that
was now her favourite wear, lying at full
length on a tiger's skin, her pretty head supported
on her folded arms, as she gazed with
wide-open eyes into the waning glories of the
evening sky; and at a little distance from Lucy,
holding on her knee, in a state of complete
eclipse, rosy baby Dick, whose mother had gone
inside to prepare for the high ceremony of his
evening toilet, the slight figure of Mrs. Lyster,
her fingers playing absently with the baby's
silken curls, as she looked out before her with
gloomy eyes. It was Kit who brought life into
the picture. He saw the rajah coming towards
them, flourishing a letter in his hand. 'Post!
Post!' he cried, rushing to meet him. 'Post!'
echoed one and another; and in a moment all
but Grace were on their feet.</p>

<p>Trixy heard the cry. For a second her
brave heart almost failed her; then, calling all
her resolution to her aid, she threw herself upon
the oars, drew them through the water with the
vigour of ten, and, in less time than it takes to
tell, was on shore and racing Kit down the
avenue. In the next instant she had seen
Bertie's handwriting, had torn the letter open,
had understood at a glance that the news was
good, and was rushing back at full speed to the
group by the lake.</p>

<p>When she reached them she was much too
breathless to speak, but her face spoke for her.
Lady Elton got up, and put her arms round her,
for this brave, healthy young creature was
swaying to and fro as if she would fall. That
was enough for her. 'Don't, mother,' she
whispered hoarsely, 'you will make me cry;
and there's nothing to cry about.' Then
Grace, who had seemed to be asleep a moment
before, held out her arms, and Trixy fell into
them with something like a sob. 'Let me go,
my sweet little Grace,' she murmured. 'I don't
even know what the silly boy has said yet.'</p>

<p>But by this time the rajah, who looked particularly
young and handsome, was amongst
them.</p>

<p>'I don't know what Captain Liston says, of
course,' he said, looking round on them with a
triumphant smile, 'but I have a message from
Sir Colin himself. It was a hard fight; but they
have done their work, and our Gumilcund guide-corps,
as well as the men with the convoy, have
done splendidly. It will be good news in the
city. I expect we shall illuminate, and have all
sorts of festivities to-morrow.'</p>

<p>'What fun!' said Lucy faintly; but she was
looking towards Trixy with anxious eyes. That
young person, who was once more the mistress
of herself and the situation, had taken a seat
under the swinging lamp, which Hoosanee had
been considerate enough to hang up among the
trees, and was unfolding Bertie's letter, parts of
which she read aloud for the benefit of everyone.</p>

<p>It had been begun on the evening of the day
when Sir Henry Havelock and the gallant
Outram had shaken hands with Sir Colin Campbell.
He had not been able, however, to despatch
it at once, and he added a few lines on
the following day. Several more important
points had been gained; the rebels were completely
demoralised, and flying in every direction;
the line of retreat for the besieged had been
organised, and the women and children and
invalids were then being carried out to the
Dilkoosha, where they were to rest for a night.
Cawnpore, he believed, was to be their next
halt. Lucy's father and mother were safe. He
had seen her husband meeting them; they
looked haggard and wasted; but already they
were on the fair way to revival. Colonel Durant
had won honour in the assault. He had himself
had one glorious moment, about which he would
entertain Trixy later. Sir Colin Campbell was
one of the best men and finest soldiers it had
ever been his lot to serve under. He would
willingly lay down his life for him. In the
meantime, though smarting in every joint from
the exertions of the preceding day, he was
thankful to say that he was sound in mind and
limb. The Gumilcund men were trumps, every
one of them. But of their gallant conduct the
rajah would no doubt hear from other sources.
To him, and the rest of the English society in
the palace and Residency, he sent warmest
greetings. The messages to herself, whose
perusal occupied a few moments, Trixy did
not think it necessary to give.</p>

<p>'That dear fellow gets more considerate every
day,' she said, looking round her with a glowing
face, as she folded up her letter. 'He doesn't
forget anybody. I should like to answer his
letter as soon as possible'&mdash;to the rajah. 'When
are you sending?'</p>

<p>'I shall send off my congratulations to-night,'
said Tom, smiling.</p>

<p>'Oh! then, excuse me everybody. I must
write at once,' said Trixy.</p>

<p>To what vagaries she committed herself in
the solitary recesses of her room, it would be
unfair to relate here. All I can venture to say
is that the letter which resulted, and which
arrived in camp on the eve of the gallant fight
that scattered Tantia Topee's army, broke the
spirit of the rebels in the North-West, and gave
back Cawnpore to the English, was received and
read with a transport of admiring love and
gratitude that its recipient would always maintain
carried him scatheless and triumphant
through the dangers of that tremendous day.</p>

<p>'I verily believe,' he said to Trixy later,
when, after his own light fashion, he was narrating
the exploit that had won for him the
English soldier's dearest reward for gallantry&mdash;the
Victoria Cross, 'I verily believe that I was
too happy and proud a creature to die that day.
There was no killing me.'</p>

<p>'The dark angel hovered over you, and had
not the heart to strike,' said Trixy, whose bright
eyes were dim with tears.</p>

<p>But this belongs to the future, for before she
met Bertie again Trixy had some dark and
bitter days to live through.</p>

<p>She was passionately attached to her mother,
and while, without understanding Grace in the
least, she had always had a sisterly regard for
her, she had never loved her as she did now,
when admiration, tenderness, pride in her as a
heroine, and some little sense of exultation in
the part she might play in the future had reinforced
her sisterly feeling. And now, since
the brief revival which followed on the news
from Lucknow, inspired partly, as Trixy felt
with a curious throb of tenderness, by sympathy
for herself and Bertie, there was added to her
love a devotion strong enough, the poor child
believed, to fight with and overcome the invisible
forces that were preying upon her sister's
life. 'Grace shall not die, she shall not!'
Trixy would say. 'I will prevent her.' For
two or three days she would let no one but
herself do anything for Grace, scarcely speak
to her. With the energy and strong will that
belonged to her, she would sweep them all
away. 'She wants life&mdash;life, do you hear?' she
would cry. 'You people are sad. You let her
brood and dream.'</p>

<p>Even Tom was only allowed to see her at
Trixy's time and in Trixy's presence. 'You
will thank me some day,' she said to him one
day, pressing his hand with sisterly cordiality,
and for the moment he almost believed in her.
'If you bring her back to us, Trixy,' he said,
with a sob in his throat, 'there is nothing I will
not do for you.'</p>

<p>'Ah, I shall remember that,' she said,
nodding to him gaily, and then she took her
measures. Kit, the gayest and naturally the
most effusive of the party, was taken into her
counsels. He was told that it was his mission
to be amusing, and he showed his sense of the
honour conferred upon him by being so delightfully
important that Trixy would almost forget
her own mission in the amusement of watching
him. Aglaia, on whose little life the shadow
which was enfolding those dearest to her seemed
to have fallen, was warned privately not to look
solemn, and she, too, began to be amusing in
pretty prim ways that were charming to behold.
'It is a perpetual little comedy with those
children,' Trixy said to her mother one day.</p>

<p>She herself was perfectly radiant. For
hours she sat beside Grace, chatting of the
present and the future. She gave quiet humorous
little pictures of incidents at Meerut, Yaseen
Khan's importance, and their father's youthful
vigour. She would even relate stories of scenes
between herself and Bertie, blushing in the
prettiest way as she repeated some of his silly
speeches. She went back over the far past
when they were all children together, raking up
funny old stories of their nursery and schoolgirl
days. She organised excursions to the
city, Grace in a palki, and she and Kit riding
beside her. For more than a week she was
her sister's only physician, and even the doctor,
who had looked grave at first, began at last
to think that the new treatment was more
successful than the old.</p>

<p>All sorts of rumours were in the meantime
pouring in, and mostly of the vengeance that
was overtaking the rebels. From the neighbourhood
of Gumilcund, from Cawnpore, and,
above all, from Delhi, came tales of wholesale
executions, of indiscriminate slaughter, of men
blown from guns in battalions, of dispossessed
peasants and citizens dying in their multitudes
from famine. The ladies heard all these things
at the Residency, where there was stern exultation.
The rajah&mdash;who was a little sombre in
these days, fearing that the reconcilement to
which he looked as a new and glorious era in
the life of the nations might be indefinitely
delayed if the conquerors could not see the
wisdom of tempering justice with mercy&mdash;was
urgent that from Grace all these dark tales
should be kept, and her friends, knowing how
sensitive she was, would not have been likely
to disappoint his wish, even though Trixy, who
kept a fierce and friendly watch, had been
absent.</p>

<p>As it was, no change was made, and yet, with
the onward sweep of the winter days, lovely
beyond description, but burdened each one with
its ghastly tale of horror, a cloud of depression,
for which there was no accounting, dropped
down upon her. Sleepless nights followed the
sad days. The doctor, saying she was too weak
to stand the continued strain, gave her anodynes
that helped her through part of the night, but
left her more exhausted than before. Then
her mother, who had let herself be lulled by
Trixy's determined hopefulness, grew alarmed.
She could sleep but little herself, and one night
she sat up and watched.</p>

<p>Grace had been given a strong opiate.
Through the early part of the night she slept,
with occasional starts. Then suddenly she
opened her eyes, and cried out like one in
deadly pain. Her mother stooped over her.
'It is a bad dream,' she said. 'Awake! I am
here beside you.'</p>

<p>The girl looked at her. 'They are binding
my eyes,' she cried with a strange bitterness.
'They think I can't see, but I can&mdash;I can! Oh,
will no one do anything? Look! Do you see,
do you see the horror in those eyes?'</p>

<p>'Whose? Whose? What do you mean,
darling? There is nothing here,' said poor Lady
Elton weeping.</p>

<p>'Nothing!' echoed the girl, 'nothing!' And
she sank down on the bed sobbing. But the next
instant she had sprung up again. 'They are
going,' she cried&mdash;'a pillar of flame. It is killing
the sweet blue of the sky&mdash;and the stars&mdash;the
stars&mdash;are fading. Oh! Where do they go?
What becomes of them? Some one told me
once; but I have forgotten.' Then, after a
pause, during which her eyes seemed to be
searching. 'It is real,' she cried, 'the pain&mdash;the
restlessness&mdash;the misery&mdash;it goes on. They cannot
destroy it&mdash;for ever and ever and ever.' Her
voice sank away to a sobbing sigh, and she sank
back exhausted. Her mother took advantage of
her quietness to whisper words of Christian hope
and comfort.</p>

<p>'You forget, my darling,' she murmured.
'There <i>is</i> a refuge&mdash;a refuge for us all. He took
the misery&mdash;He bore the pain. Look to Him&mdash;the
Crucified&mdash;our Saviour.'</p>

<p>The girl looked up. The familiar words had
penetrated the cloud of her delirium; but they
brought with them no peace, rather a strange
fierce anger of impatience that pierced her gentle
mother to the heart.</p>

<p>'Our Saviour! but who is theirs?' she
cried piteously, and then again came that awful
heart-rending cry&mdash;inarticulate&mdash;the wail of a
hurt and bewildered child. Lady Elton was on
her knees by the bedside, tears raining from her
eyes. 'It is breaking my heart,' she sobbed.
'Oh! Grace, don't you know me?'</p>

<p>Slowly the girl seemed to come back to herself.
'Mother,' she said, 'is it you?' Then
with a strange smile: 'I was foolish to wish to
see. Bind my eyes! Hide me! I dare not look.'</p>

<p>'My child! there is nothing. But come to me.
Hide your dear head. My little darling! My baby!
Oh! if I might hide you so always,' said the poor
woman, 'as I did when you were really a baby!'</p>

<p>Grace lay perfectly still, her head on her
mother's arm.</p>

<p>'You are better, love?' she whispered,
stroking her hair with trembling fingers.</p>

<p>'Yes,' answered the girl. 'But it will come
back again. Dear, you must let me go.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next day she was too weak to rise.
Everyone was distressed, and Trixy's anguish
was terrible. But after the first shock she persisted
that it was nothing.</p>

<p>'Sick people are subject to these fluctuations,'
she said fiercely; 'Grace will be better to-morrow.'</p>

<p>But Lady Elton knew that the summons had
come. She told Tom of the scene of the night.
As he listened a ghastly pallor overspread his
face, and he staggered like one who has received
a blow.</p>

<p>'Some one has told her these hideous
stories,' he cried with sudden anger. 'The
horror of them is killing her.'</p>

<p>Lady Elton put her tender, motherly hand
on his shoulder. 'No, dear,' she said sadly; 'I
have watched; and Trixy, and the child, Aglaia,
have been with her from morning till night. <i>It
is impossible!</i>'</p>

<p>For an instant he stood silent. Every
particle of colour had fled from his face, and his
eyes had a strained, unnatural expression that
alarmed her.</p>

<p>'I will watch with you to-night,' he said.</p>

<p>'If she will let you.'</p>

<p>'She shall not see me. I will keep out of
her way, while she is awake. Mother, you must
let me. It is my right, and,' he added in a
choked voice, as he turned from her,'perhaps I
know more about these visions than you do.'</p>

<p>Lady Elton went back sadly to her children.
She found Aglaia curled up on the cushions at
Grace's feet, reading the New Testament to her,
and Trixy sitting beside them with swollen
eyes.</p>

<p>With an unuttered prayer Lady Elton sat
down and listened. It was one of the beautiful,
mystical chapters of St. John. The child read it
through, in her sweet tremulous voice, and then
stopped.</p>

<p>'Grace is asleep,' she whispered.</p>

<p>They sat silent, watching her. Her face was
almost transparent. The blue-veined eyelids,
fringed with long silken lashes, lay against her
cheeks. The breathing was soft and regular, like
a child's. But she was not asleep, and presently
she opened her eyes, and looked round on
them.</p>

<p>'How good everyone is to me!' she murmured.
'What have I done that you should
love me so?' Then in a lower tone, 'Mother,
love is real.'</p>

<p>Her mother trembled, for she knew that the
vision of the night before was with her.</p>

<p>'Love is real; love will conquer,' said
Trixy.</p>

<p>Grace turned to her, and for a moment there
seemed to be on the dying face some faint reflection
of the fire and enthusiasm that shone
from that of the living. 'Thank you, Trixy,'
she murmured, 'say that again. It does me
good.'</p>

<p>'But it is true&mdash;it is true&mdash;how could anything
else be?' cried the young girl. 'Love is
real&mdash;it is strong&mdash;it is the strongest&mdash;it conquers
everything&mdash;we know it&mdash;we who have
felt.' And then sudden tears dimmed the lustre
of her eyes, and she bent her head. 'Grace,
dearest,' she whispered. 'Our love is calling
you. Won't you&mdash;won't you&mdash;stay?' For an
instant the large grey eyes, that were fixed on
Trixy's face, seemed to lose their steadfastness.</p>

<p>'Life is very sweet,' murmured Grace, 'to
go on&mdash;to know&mdash;to love&mdash;to see the world
opening out&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Life is beautiful,' said Trixy. 'Life is
divine. You shall not die. It would be cruel.'</p>

<p>'Hush! Hush!' said Lady Elton. 'Do you
see?'</p>

<p>A faint colour had tinged the white face on
the pillow, and the large eyes had filled with
tears. Trixy turned away with a sob in her
throat.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A little later they brought her food. She
tried her hardest to eat, but she could not.
Presently her mother saw her lips moving and
bent over her. 'I have been thinking about it,'
she said faintly. 'I am afraid my heart and
brain are weak. I can't bear things as others
do. If I stayed I should be a trouble to you.
Tell Trixy,' and then again, in a still lower
voice, 'somewhere else I may understand better.'</p>

<p>They noticed that, throughout that day, she
watched Aglaia with a curious wistful expression
in her eyes. Once when Tom, who was
coming in and going out helplessly all day long,
sat down beside her bed, she drew the child towards
her, and put her little hand in his. But
she said very little, and none of them spoke to
her much. All but Trixy were abandoning
hope; she hoped on still.</p>

<p>In the evening Grace seemed better and
stronger; she asked for fruit, and they brought
her the richest and rarest that could be procured.
There were baskets of fragrant white flowers
in the room. She asked for one to be placed on
her bed, and, for a few minutes, her thin pale
fingers strayed lovingly over the cool petals.
One little white rose she pressed to her lips.</p>

<p>'It is such a pleasant sensation to touch them,'
she said; 'they are so pure, so sweet.'</p>

<p>Late in the evening the doctor paid her a
visit, gave her an anodyne and spoke with doubtful
cheerfulness. Kit, and Mrs. Lyster, and Mrs.
Durant, and baby Dick and his mother, and
poor little Lucy came in, one by one, to bid her
good-night. They had been sternly drilled by
Trixy, and none of them wept or sighed. Trixy
herself and Aglaia, who had begged hard not to
be sent away, sat with her until ten o'clock;
then Lady Elton insisted that they should rest,
and they went into the inner room where they
slept together.</p>

<p>Tom had by this time crept in. By one of
the marble lattices there was a deep recess, shut
off from the rest of the room by a screen. In
this recess he took up his station. The early
hours of the night passed quickly by. Grace
seemed to be asleep. There was no movement,
not the least sound of life in all the palace.
Even the chattering of the chowkedars was
silent, in obedience to the orders he had sent
out by Hoosanee. That faithful servant was
keeping his watch in the hall of the zenana; but
he did not so much as move. Outside Tom
could hear a soft wind stirring in the heavy
foliage of the trees, and silver arrows of light,
shot earthwards from shining worlds, myriads of
miles away, stole in through the lattice. Years
afterwards he remembered, with a throb of pain,
how wide and how desolate the universe seemed
to him that night. Tired as he was when he
began his watch, he did not feel the least disposition
to sleep; his mind was too busy, too poignantly
alive, his heart was too full. As the
night wore on, dark and terrible thoughts
assailed him. Once he could have cried out like
a hurt child. The cruelty of life smote him,
the piteous waste of force&mdash;hearts large with
love, souls aching with passionate pity, and able
to do nothing!</p>

<p>Down the sheltered river the little boat might
be brought, furthered tenderly by guardian
hands. Upon the sea, wide, fathomless, undiscovered,
the awful sea of eternity, it must launch
out alone. This was the mystery that oppressed
him. Later he might think of himself, his own
sorrow and loss and disappointment. Now all
his heart and mind were with the sweet soul
that was going out from them into the invisible.</p>

<p>A sense of defeat and powerlessness, almost
intolerable in its anguish, came over him. He
got up and struck his forehead against the
marble lattice, and the sharp pain of the blow
seemed to bring him back to himself.</p>

<p>Now and then he would rise from his seat
behind the screen and look back into the room.
By the light of the shaded lamp he could see
the mother's bent form as she turned over the
pages of her book, and the white, white face
upon the pillow, as still now as if death had
frozen it into the everlasting silence. Twice he
saw Lady Elton rise swiftly and lean over her,
and then his heart beat so tumultuously that he
thought she must have heard it. But she returned
to her seat, and he knew that there was
still breath.</p>

<p>So on for hours that seemed like a lifetime.
At last the darkness began to lift. Through the
lattice by which he was standing he saw the
stars grow high and pale, and the grey light of
early morning stealing over the earth. The
air came in with the chill of the morning in
it, and he drew the screen further round the
lattice lest it should touch the white face on the
pillow.</p>

<p>Ah! what was that? A cry! In an instant
he was by the bedside; Grace was sitting up.
Her eyes were wide open, her arms were extended,
her voice was clear and strong. 'Keep
me awake, Kit,' she cried, 'keep me awake!'
Then in a voice lower, but thrilled through and
through with ecstasy, 'Tom! Tom!'</p>

<p>A mist was before his eyes. He did not see
Lady Elton, who was chafing the poor little feet
that were deadly cold. The room, the bed, the
flowers, the rich and costly things that were
scattered about her, had vanished away. He
was in the hermit's hut once more, and his
darling, torn from the jaws of death, was at his
feet. With an inarticulate cry, he threw himself
on his knees and held out his arms. She sank into
them like a tired child, a smile of ineffable peace
on her lips. But the touch of her cold cheek
recalled him to the present. 'She is worse,' he
said, looking at her with eyes full of anguish.
'Mother, for God's sake, can nothing be done?'</p>

<p>Sorrowfully the poor mother shook her head.
She had looked on death too often not to know
it.</p>

<p>At that moment there was another voice&mdash;a
cry stifled but full of pain. It was Trixy. With
white gown and bare feet, her hair flying wildly
about her shoulders, she stood in the doorway between
the two rooms. In an instant she had taken
it all in, and was rushing madly across the room.
'You are dreaming, all of you,' she cried. 'She
is in a swoon; I know it is nothing else. Where
is that cordial? She was nearly off yesterday,
and I brought her back with it. And the
doctor. Aglaia, fly for him! Tell him Grace is
in a faint. Tom, give her this; she must take
it, she must. Heavens! how helpless men are!
let me try! Grace, sweetest, it is Trixy, your
sister. For her sake! see love!'&mdash;her tears were
raining over the white hands&mdash;'Grace, I shall
never be happy again if you leave us! Try
this once, and no one shall torture you again as
long as you live. One little drop if you love
me!' The spoon was between her lips, but it
was in vain, she could not swallow. Yet the
sister's passionate agony had done what the
lover's voice could not. For an instant the
heavy eyelids were lifted. Ah! what a look!
dumb pain! speechless entreaty! To the day
of her death it will haunt the sister's heart; she
will see it in her dreams. The rest was like a
trance, a vision. She seemed to hear a voice
whispering to her to be still, and then a great
chill struck her, and she smiled to think that
she was going away with Grace, and there was
a confusion of many hands and voices about
her, and she thought with a vague pity of Bertie;
and the next thing she knew she was starting
out of what seemed like a deep sleep and seeing
her mother sitting beside her; but when she tried
to get up, and said that she would go to Grace,
her mother laid her hand upon her. 'Grace
died last night,' she said.</p>

<p>'Last night!' echoed Trixy, falling back.</p>

<p>'And you have slept all day, my poor little
one,' said Lady Elton, stooping to kiss her.</p>

<p>Trixy lay like one bewildered.</p>

<p>'And Tom?' she said presently.</p>

<p>'I have not seen him since. I hope he has
been sleeping too.'</p>

<p>'Poor Tom!' said Trixy, her eyes filling
with tears. 'His trouble is greater than ours.'</p>

<p>'Yes; and think of all he has done for us.
I shall thank God to the day of my death that
we had this quiet happy time together,' said
poor Lady Elton, with a little stifled sob.</p>

<p>'You are better than I am, mother. I can't
feel anything but angry yet. But not with Tom.
Oh! not with Tom! He is a hero,' cried poor
little Trixy.</p>

<h5><a name="CHAPTER_LIV" id="CHAPTER_LIV">CHAPTER LIV</a></h5>

<h4>COMING BACK TO LIFE</h4>


<p>Of the days that followed immediately I have
neither space nor inclination to write many
words. It was a time of deep anxiety in Gumilcund,
where it soon became evident that the
young rajah, who had battled so stoutly with
hardship, difficulty, danger, and disappointment,
was seriously ill. His spirit was high, but his
bodily powers were not equal to the task of
sustaining it. Though he kept about and did,
to the best of his ability, the tasks that fell in
his way, those in the palace, and indeed many
beyond it, saw that his strength was failing
daily. At last, and, as some of them said later,
providentially, the crisis came. A chill caught
in a night ride through the city brought on
fever. For several days he lay hovering between
life and death. Lady Elton used to say
that this illness of Tom's saved both her and
him from madness. He was compelled to obey
the voice of nature, and keep quiet for a time.
She, having to put her own poignant grief aside
and to assume a cheerfulness which she was far
from feeling, found life, with its homely joys and
sorrows, take hold of her once more. Grace
had gone away into the invisible, but these
others remained; Tom, who had to be wooed
back with the tenderest care to the paths of the
living; Trixy, who had to be persuaded&mdash;poor,
impulsive child!&mdash;that it was not wicked to be
happy; Kit and Aglaia, who watched her to and
fro with the most pitiful, beseeching eyes; Lucy,
'a very Niobe for tears'; and her dear old
General, who sent urgent messages that she
would take care of herself, and not add to his
sorrow and remorse by leaving them when they
wanted her the most.</p>

<p>Her first really joyful moment after Grace's
death was when, with finger on lip but eyes
dancing with pleasure, she looked in, after a long
absence, on the little melancholy party in the
pillared hall of the zenana and whispered, 'The
rajah is better; he is sleeping naturally; the
doctor gives hope.'</p>

<p>It was delightful to see the sad faces relax,
and to hear the fervent congratulations. Up
to this Lady Elton had allowed no one to
take her place. She and Hoosanee, whose
devotion was unlimited, took the severer part of
the nursing between them. But now, when all
crowded round her, entreating to be allowed
to take their share, she chose out Mrs. Lyster to
join her. She knew, by the instincts of her own
sad heart, that the service would be a comfort
and relief to her who had suffered more than any
of them, and, indeed, the clever, resourceful
little Irishwoman, with her bright ways, her ready
smiles, and her unconquerable and delicious
sense of humour, proved a most valuable
assistant.</p>

<p>Never was man or woman more tenderly
nursed than our young rajah. Later he used to
tell his friends that they forced him back to life.
It would have been the basest ingratitude on
his part not to try to get better when they were
all so anxious and careful for him. The vigorous
constitution which he had inherited, and
which no excess had ever spoiled, stood him in
even better stead than the nursing. Life in him
was far too strong to be fatally worsted in this
first serious encounter with its foes. But it was
a changed life. This, when he came amongst
them again, they all recognised. It was a graver
man&mdash;one not so prone to the exhibition of feeling&mdash;who
rose from that bed of sickness. The
boy, with his raptures, his poetic transports, and
his passionate enthusiasms, had gone. The man,
quiet, reserved, courteous, but withal stern and
decided, had taken his place. The people, to
whom he presented himself as soon as his doctor
would permit the exertion, said that his resemblance
to his predecessor, Byrajee Pirtha Raj,
was more striking than ever.</p>

<p>Grace died in December. Before January
had run its course the little party of ladies in
the zenana had begun to break up. Travelling
being once more possible, their relatives felt that
it was not fair to tax the hospitality of the Rajah
of Gumilcund any further.</p>

<p>Little Dick and his mother were the first to
go; a haven in the hills had been provided for
them until the spring, when they were to return
to England.</p>

<p>Then came the turn of Mrs. Durant and the
gallant Kit. Colonel Durant had been able to
provide an escort for his wife and son to Calcutta,
whence he wished them to proceed directly to
England. He wrote to Tom as to an Eastern
prince, thanking him earnestly for his protection
and help, and asking if he could be of any use
to him with the Government. Tom wrote that
the consciousness of having been of service to
English people was a more than sufficient reward
for all he had done. If, however, he might be
allowed not to lose sight of Kit, who was a
charming little fellow, and his particular friend,
he would take it as a kindness.</p>

<p>Kit was exceedingly reluctant to go. He
did not see, he said, why they could not stay
with the rajah. Gumilcund, he was sure, was
quite as good as London, and Bâl Narîn taught
him all he wanted to know. But Kit had to
leave, his protest notwithstanding.</p>

<p>The Nepaulese shikari, who had continued to
be Kit's devoted attendant, left Gumilcund at the
same time as his <i>chota Sahib</i>, with whom he
meant to travel as far as Calcutta. Bâl Narîn,
so far as means were concerned, was now a
gentleman at large, Tom having settled upon
him a sufficient income to enable him to live
in comfort and without toil for the rest of his
days. It was his intention now to see the world.
Besides Lady Elton, whom the General was
urging to return to Meerut, preparatorily to a
start for England, which he meditated shortly,
there were now in the palace only Lucy, Mrs.
Lyster, and Aglaia.</p>

<p>Lucy's husband, who was on active service,
could easily have made arrangements for her
to go to the hills; but she begged to remain at
Gumilcund, and, as there was no particular
reason why she should move, Captain Robertson
accepted with gratitude the rajah's proposal that
she should make her home in his city until his
own active service was over. Being Bertie
Liston's comrade, he knew more about the Rajah
of Gumilcund than Colonel Durant.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lyster, whose husband and baby were
gone, had no ties in India. The dear ones at
home were drawing her; but they were provided
for, and there was no need for hurry.
When plans were talked over, she agreed gladly
to remain in Gumilcund, looking after the little
Aglaia until they could both be sent home.
Of Aglaia's present departure there was no
question. Her mother and father had gone.
Her friends in England believed doubtless that
she had died with them. In time to come, Tom
promised himself to look them up; but, for the
moment, she belonged to her deliverer.</p>

<p>As for Lady Elton, she simply declined to
leave Gumilcund until Tom could be said to be
in his usual health. She owed this, she wrote to
his mother, to himself, to Grace. The General
might come to her and Trixy. They could not
go to him.</p>

<p>The wild work in the neighbourhood of
Meerut, which had earned the <i>Khakee Ressalah</i>
their laurels, was by this time over. The courts
were open; the country was comparatively
quiet; the robber-tribes having taken warning
by one or two notable executions, had taken
what was left of them elsewhere, and the
peasants were coming back slowly to rebuild
their little villages of mud huts, and to cultivate
their fields. The General, who had nothing
to do in this work of organisation, finding for
the second time his occupation gone, gathered a
few volunteers round him and set off for Gumilcund,
which he reached, without the least
difficulty, one evening in February.</p>

<p>The young rajah was convalescent, but not
off the invalid list. The visitor, recognised at
once as an Englishman of distinction, was shown
into the ante-room of Tom's sleeping apartment,
where, having been left by his kind nurses
for the night, he was reclining in a nest of
cushions. He sprang up, and held out both his
hands.</p>

<p>'General!' he cried. 'You!'</p>

<p>'Yes, my boy,' said the old man brokenly.
'I have come to look you up, you see, as I
couldn't persuade you to come to Meerut. Sit
down! Sit down! You have been ill?'</p>

<p>'Nothing to speak of; though my dear
nurse, Lady Elton, insists on coddling me still.
Shall I send for her?'</p>

<p>'Presently. I should like to have a little
talk with you first, if it won't be too much for
you.'</p>

<p>'My dear sir, I am well, perfectly well.'</p>

<p>Very strange and sad was the conversation
that followed. When Tom, who knew the high
soul, the resolute nature, and the grand audacity
of his old friend, found him stammering and
faltering, pouring out thanks and blessings,
and stopping in the midst of broken words
to reproach himself bitterly for the blind and
credulous folly which had precipitated them all
into danger, he was too much moved to answer.</p>

<p>But, meanwhile, the rumour of the arrival
had spread in the palace, and Lady Elton,
yearning to see her dear old General, and fearful
of the exciting effects of his conversation upon
her patient, wrapped herself in her veil, and
went hastily through the corridors that separated
their apartments from those of the rajah.</p>

<p>When the emotion of the two men was at
its highest point, she stood between them, a
hand on both. 'It is enough, Wilfrid,' she
said. 'He is our son; you must not thank him
too much.'</p>

<p>'Thank you,' murmured Tom.</p>

<p>As for the General, he took up his gentle
wife in his arms and asked her, with a plaintiveness
that came strangely from him, if she meant
to desert him and the girls for ever. Tom smiled
and left them together.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of course the General was irresistible. When
Lady Elton met Tom the following day, she told
him that she must leave him. 'I really believe
you have turned the corner, dear,' she said, 'and
they are so devoted to you; besides, there is Mrs.
Lyster. She promises faithfully not to go until
you are quite well. My dear old General doesn't
seem to be able to get on without me. It is very
foolish&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Dearest Lady Elton, I would not keep you
for the world. It has been too good and kind
of you to stay so long,' said Tom.</p>

<p>'Hush! Hush!' said Lady Elton reproachfully.
'Is that the way sons speak to their
mothers? But, seriously, the General says that
if things go on as they are doing now, he will
take us home in April or May. You ought to
come with us.'</p>

<p>'And leave Gumilcund?'</p>

<p>'Oh! not for always of course. Spend the
summer at home, and go back in the winter.
The change will do you good, both in your body
and mind.'</p>

<p>'I don't think I care much to go to England
now,' said Tom. He was gazing out at the
garden, the azure-blue lake, and the purple
outline of the hills behind them, and thinking
sorrowfully of his old dreams.</p>

<p>'But that is just it,' pleaded Lady Elton.
'You should make yourself care. I know how
people slip into not-caring, dear. It is the worst
of complaints. It takes all the hope and heart
out of you. Think of us&mdash;of your mother&mdash;of
England&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes: I will think,' he answered gently, and
that was all she could persuade him to say then.</p>

<p>General Elton spoke to him more strongly.
He had not seen him since his visit to Meerut, in
the bright and joyous days that preceded the
mutiny, and he was shocked by the change in his
appearance. 'My dear boy,' he said, 'if you
value your health&mdash;if you value your reason&mdash;if
you wish to continue the useful career which
you have begun so nobly, you must give yourself
rest and change. Tell me frankly, is there
anything to prevent your taking a holiday?'</p>

<p>'I don't think so,' answered Tom. 'The
crisis is over, and things have been set going.
They will work very well without me. It is not
a question of being spared.'</p>

<p>'No; it is want of will. Now, my dear
fellow, in your mother's name, as well as in that
of others, I must scold you.'</p>

<p>'Poor mother!' he murmured.</p>

<p>'She has been eating her heart out with
anxiety this dreadful year; you may be sure of
it. You owe her a little comfort&mdash;a little consideration.'</p>

<p>'I owe her everything,' said Tom impulsively.
'Don't urge me too much, General. You would
be the first to tell me to consider my duty.'</p>

<p>'Of course I should. But your duty, it seems
to me, is as plain as a pikestaff. You have to
look to the re-establishment of your health. If
you think that is to come about in a summer in
the plains&mdash;over a hundred in the shade and
other things to follow suit&mdash;why, all I can say is
that you are hugely mistaken.'</p>

<p>Having delivered himself thus, the old
General stalked off, for he believed that his
words would take more effect if he did not
bolster them up with too many arguments.
Tom consulted Chunder Singh. He said plainly
that he belonged to Gumilcund. Since the recent
events which had endeared to him unspeakably
both the city and those who dwelt in it, he
had felt that no other place in the world could ever
be his home. It was not his intention, however,
to give up his English citizenship altogether.
Chunder Singh, who was a wise man, knew very
well that the maintenance of those cordial
relations&mdash;that sympathy&mdash;with the Paramount
Power which had enabled them to steer, not
only safely but triumphantly, through the late
dangerous crisis, was a matter of importance
to Gumilcund. These, he believed, would be
strengthened by personal intercourse with England,
which he had always proposed to visit
from time to time. His friends wished him to go
over that summer. The question was, would
the people and the elders of the State consider
the time suitable? Would there be any fear&mdash;any
panic?</p>

<p>Taken by surprise, Chunder Singh asked for
a few hours' delay to consider and consult his
colleagues. The consideration proved favourable
to General Elton's scheme. The people of
Gumilcund thought that there could be no
better time than the present for their rajah's
visit to England. The country in the immediate
neighbourhood of the city was quiet. The rebellion,
though not completely quenched, had
received its death-blow in the defeat of Tantia
Topee outside Cawnpore. The mutineers still
on foot had far too much to do battling with the
strong forces set in array against them to think
of attacking Gumilcund. The business of the
State itself was moving with the regularity of
clockwork. Moreover, it was well-known that
in the council chambers of the English
Parliament momentous questions regarding the
future government of India were being mooted.
Under such circumstances, it would be advisable
that their rajah, whose influence these good
people naturally overrated, should be at hand.
Let him then depart; let him think for them
and scheme for them in England as he had done
here; and when the fiery summer had run its
course, let him return to the city, as to a
home!</p>

<p>So said Chunder Singh, as the mouthpiece of
Gumilcund.</p>

<p>When the General and his wife, and brave
little Trixy departed, they took with them a
promise, that if nothing came about in the
meantime to prevent him, Tom would start
with them for England in the month of April.</p>

<h5><a name="CHAPTER_LV" id="CHAPTER_LV">CHAPTER LV</a></h5>

<h4>IN ENGLAND AGAIN: CONCLUSION</h4>


<p>Let us take a leap in time and space! Leaving
behind us the crowded cities, the dusky tribes,
the deep skies and burning plains of India, let us
cross the Black Water, and return to the little
island of the West, whence the hands that have
subdued these strange regions and the minds&mdash;many
of the greatest of them, alas! gone forth
from earth and her concerns for ever&mdash;that have
governed them, took their origin. We are in
England once more, and the month is the
sweetest month of all the year&mdash;leaf-clad, rose-embowered
June.</p>

<p>Just two years have gone by since the day
when Thomas Gregory, the widow's son, received
the news which was destined to change the whole
current of his life, and was visited by a dream
stranger than any of those he had encountered
in his nightly excursions through the many
visions of his poet friends. Yes; and we are in
the very same spot where then we saw him receive
the letter&mdash;the garden of the little cottage
in which his early years were spent.</p>

<p>It has changed very little. The same green
summer-house looks down upon the river, which
murmurs eternally the same sweet song; the
same willows brush it with feathery, golden-green
branches; the same flowers, once so dear to
Grace and Tom&mdash;azure-blue speedwell and dainty
forget-me-not, and starry celandine&mdash;mantle
now, as they did then, the low, sloping bank
with beauty; the same soft mossy lawn sweeps
down to the river bank; the same weeping-ash
lifts its green tent from the green carpet; above
the lawn are the same carefully-trimmed fruit
and flower gardens. The cottage which, from
where we stand, we can see peeping through a
delicious network of foliage and blossoming
trees, looks newer than of old, and there are
certainly more boats upon the river; but these
are the only changes.</p>

<p>No one lives in the cottage now. It is looked
after by a gardener and his wife. Mrs. Gregory,
who owns it still, has had it, at her son's request,
rebuilt and kept in perfect order, but she lives
herself in the fine house, built, as all the neighbourhood
knows, after her son's design, on the
high ground above the river. Folks say that
she likes the cottage better than the mansion.
Often, in the evening, when the weather is soft
and mild, she comes down to the little place to
see if her orders are being carried out. Last
summer, during the dreadful days of suspense
and anguish when no one knew what a day
might bring forth, she haunted the cottage and
garden like an unquiet ghost. Mrs. Stevens, the
good old wife of her faithful gardener, could,
if she liked, tell sad tales of the frenzy which
would now and then seize upon the unhappy
lady, as she stole round the little garden, in
which she had spent so many tranquil days, or
sat wringing her hands and weeping in the room
that had been her son's.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Gregory is happier and more hopeful
now, for the peril is over, and her son has
promised her a visit. She is in the garden this
evening. Dressed richly, in costly black lace
and silk, with a Spanish mantilla thrown over
her head, she is walking backwards and forwards
slowly on the lawn above the river. She has
changed in these two years. Her hair is perfectly
white now, her figure, not nearly so full
as of old, has a tendency to droop, and her face,
whose comely outlines and healthy colour made
her once the admiration and envy of her middle-aged
friends, has lost its roundness. Neither
have her eyes the brightness which they possessed
then. If we look at her closely, we shall
remark a curious pallor and tremulousness
about them; while in all her movements there
is a restlessness&mdash;a nervous timidity, pitiful in
one of her age and condition.</p>

<p>She is joined presently by a neat-looking,
elderly woman, in black gown, white apron and
mob cap.</p>

<p>'Tea is ready, ma'am,' she says. 'Shall I
bring it out to the lawn, or will you take it in
the parlour?'</p>

<p>'Tea!' echoes Mrs. Gregory. 'Why, to be
sure! I told you to get tea for me, didn't I?
I had forgotten.' And she turns with a sigh to
walk up the garden.</p>

<p>'Mayn't I take your parcel, ma'am?' said the
gardener's wife pleasantly. 'It's too heavy for
you.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Gregory looks down with a start. In
her right hand is a bulky packet, which she is
holding with a curious tension pressed tightly
against her side.</p>

<p>'This!' she exclaims. 'Oh no, thank you!
It is not in the least heavy. I have promised,
besides, to give it into no hands but my son's.'</p>

<p>'Bless me, ma'am, do you really mean to say
so?' cries Mrs. Stevens, who is astonished to
find her offer treated so seriously. 'But I only
meant carrying it to the house. You look hard
put to it to carry yourself to-night, if I may
make so bold. My William and me was just
saying this very evening as it might be, "If so
be as Mr. Thomas don't come soon, there won't
be much left of the missis for him to see." But
it won't be long now, as the saying is.'</p>

<p>'No, it won't be long now. I was just trying,
when you came out, to reckon the time by his
last letter. It seems to me that he ought to
have been here before this.'</p>

<p>At this very moment&mdash;they had reached the
upper lawn and flower-garden&mdash;Mrs. Stevens,
who was a little in front of her mistress, saw
a hackney carriage pull up at the gate. She
turned round. 'Ma'am! ma'am!' she cried,
'there's some one come. Don't faint, like a
dear! William, I say, William, run to the gate!
I'll go through the house and open the hall-door.'</p>

<p>There followed a few moments of agonising
suspense, and then, how it came about Mrs.
Gregory never knew, she found herself lying in
her son's arms, helpless as a child, with his
warm kisses raining upon her cheeks and lips
and brow.</p>

<p>Her first thought, strange as it may seem,
was not of him, but of the packet which she
had been carrying, and which Mrs. Stevens
had picked up from the ground when in that
intoxicating moment her senses had deserted
her. Drawing herself away from her son, she
made a rapid sign that it should be given to
her, and when Mrs. Stevens obeyed she hid it
in her mantilla. This man&#339;uvre was unnoticed
by Tom, all whose thoughts were of her.</p>

<p>'So I have frightened you, little mother!'
he said. 'And yet I sent a message. Didn't
you receive it? It should have arrived early
in the day.'</p>

<p>'I was out very likely. I took lunch with
Lady Winter, and then I came on here. But
I am not sorry. I wanted to see you first here,
dear; here, where we have been so happy. I
thought you would be more likely to forgive
me and think kindly of me.'</p>

<p>'Dearest mother, you are dreaming. Forgive!
What have I to forgive? Are you
tormenting yourself because you could not
make up your mind to tell me by word of
mouth what you told me by letter? But that
is the most natural thing in the world to me.
And as to the days that have gone, we are to
have better ones, little mother, much&mdash;much
better. Let me look at you. Do you know
that you have changed?'</p>

<p>'Yes, dear, I have changed. I couldn't help
it,' with a plaintive little smile, and clinging to
him like a child. 'If I could have been certain,
quite certain, of this beautiful moment, I would
have kept myself as I was. Do you remember
how you used to call me your pretty, rosy, little
mother?'</p>

<p>'You will be my pretty, rosy, little mother
again,' said Tom. 'Ah, there is the colour
coming! A good beginning!'</p>

<p>'And you, Tom, you! You have changed,
too, my son. But I expected that. Your face
is sterner; there are some sad lines. Your
eyes. Ah! how they carry me back to the past!
How foolish, how foolish I have been!'</p>

<p>'In what way, mother?'</p>

<p>'In dreaming that I could keep you. You
are his.'</p>

<p>'I am yours, too, little mother. It was his
wish, his thought. But we shall have plenty of
time to talk seriously. This evening I want to
enjoy.' He looked round him. 'How good it
is to find you here in this dear old garden!' he
said. 'Give me your hand, and let us make
one round as we used to, you know, and then
you must come back with me to your fine house
on the hill, where I have left our travellers. I
suppose, by the bye, that that stylish-looking
housekeeper of yours can be trusted to look
after them for a few minutes?'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes. She is perfect. Lady Winter
trained her. And everything has been ready
for you for days. But I ought to be there
myself to welcome them. Did the dear child
bear the journey well?'</p>

<p>'I think it did her good. She has had a
more natural life than at Gumilcund. Such a
number of children, many of them orphans,
came home with us, and Aglaia was like a little
mother amongst them. Mrs. Lyster, I am
afraid, will only stop with us to-night. She is
impatient naturally to see her own little ones,
who are at school in Ireland. If you don't
mind, I want you to ask her to bring them all
to us for the summer holidays.'</p>

<p>'Certainly, dear; it will be a pleasure to
me. And the General, and my dear, dear Lady
Elton, and the girls&mdash;what have they done?'</p>

<p>'I left them in London. A house has been
taken for them there for a few months. I
suppose you know that we left Trixy behind us?'</p>

<p>'Yes; Lady Elton wrote. Dear little Trixy!
I hope she will be happy.'</p>

<p>'I think she has every chance of it,' said
Tom, smiling. 'Bertie Liston is one of the best
fellows I know.'</p>

<p>'And the others, when shall I see them?'
said Mrs. Gregory.</p>

<p>'We must bring them down,' said Tom.
'What should you think of persuading them to
make the cottage their country home during the
summer? Lady Elton won't be able to bear
much racketing about; the quiet of this place
and your society would be the best medicine for
her, and pottering about the garden would just
suit the dear old General.'</p>

<p>'It would be delightful,' said Mrs. Gregory.
'We must see what we can do.'</p>

<p>They were close to the river bank. It was a
serene and lovely evening, and the water was
gay with boat-loads of holiday-makers. As the
mother and son stood, for a moment, looking
down the stream, a skiff full of young people
floated past them. The girls wore light dresses;
they were laughing and talking gaily. It went
on, and another followed, then another. With
wet eyes and a painful contraction of heart the
young man turned away. 'Mother!' he said.
'Do you remember?'</p>

<p>'Two years ago,' she murmured. 'Yes; I
remember very well; how beautiful they were!'</p>

<p>'<i>She</i> was beautiful to the last,' said Tom in
a whisper.</p>

<p>'You must tell me of her, dear. It will do
you good, and I, yes; it will do me good too.
I loved her so. I built so many hopes upon her.'</p>

<p>'So dreams pass!' said Tom.</p>

<p>'No, no,' said his mother, grasping at his
arm; 'not pass&mdash;nothing that is good goes quite
away. They come back again, brighter and
purer and more beautiful. My son, believe me!
I am simple, I know, far too simple to be the
wife and mother of great men; but,' smiling
sweetly through her tears, 'the simple sometimes
see further than the wise. And now let us come
back to the house and welcome my new daughter
and your dear friend.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The meeting between Mrs. Gregory and her
guests was very pleasant and touching. The
traces of sadness which gave a new dignity to
her charming face, her gentle motherliness, and
her ardent anxiety to be sure that they were
comfortable and at their ease, won Mrs. Lyster's
warm heart at once. Aglaia, in whom Mrs.
Gregory at once recognised a sensitiveness like
her own, did not respond to her advances so
readily; but she was careful not to alarm the
child by being too demonstrative all at once, and
in a very short time her gentle reverence told.
Before that evening was over, Aglaia was talking
in the little quaint fashion which was so peculiarly
her own, answering with pretty childlike sedateness
all the questions put to her, and looking
up at Daddy Tom's mother with unmistakable
admiration and confidence.</p>

<p>To Mrs. Gregory the evening that followed
was almost dream-like in its charm. The delight
of having her son with her, of waiting upon
him, of seeing him take possession of the things
which she had spent so many happy hours preparing
for him, the pleasure of entertaining these
dear guests, who had escaped, by her son's
hand, from peril so awful that the memory of
it made her shudder&mdash;the joy, after her long
famine of home affections, in uniting them round
her table; in looking from face to face; in
listening to tales which were all of the valour of
her boy, and the beauty and dignity of his city
in the far East; whose wonderful arrangements,
Mrs. Lyster would insist, were due to no one but
himself&mdash;all this it would take a more graphic
pen than mine to describe. I doubt, in fact, if
words could do justice to it. But for a little
pricking sense of discomfort, an ever-recurrent
consciousness of something painful to be done
before she could rest, Mrs. Gregory would have
been perfectly happy that evening.</p>

<p>It came to an end, as all happy times must
and will. Sumbaten, who, at her earnest
entreaty, had been allowed to cross the Black
Water with her adored Missy Sahib, had long
since taken Aglaia to the pretty nursery provided
for them. Family prayers had been read.
Mrs. Lyster, who, while Tom went off with
Hoosanee to see his new quarters, had lingered
to tell one or two stories, which she could not
tell before him, had risen to say good-night. Mrs.
Gregory accompanied her to her room, and left
her there.</p>

<p>The house was very still; she had a little
silver lamp in her hand, with which it was her
custom to go round every night and make sure
that all the bolts and bars were fastened. Mrs.
Lyster's room opened on to an upper gallery,
which commanded the lower hall. She lingered
for a moment, her heart beating, and her lips
quivering nervously. The lights here were out;
but the large hanging lamp below was alight
still. As she stood looking down, her son came
out of one of the rooms on the ground-floor and
stood under it. 'Do you want the hall lamp
put out?' he said. 'Hoosanee and I have been
round.'</p>

<p>'Thank you, dear,' she answered nervously.
'Yes, put it out. I will say good-night to you in
your room.'</p>

<p>Then she turned, ran hastily to her own
room, and, having seized a packet which lay
on the table, went back with it to the upper
gallery.</p>

<p>The door of Tom's apartments stood open.</p>

<p>There was a little study exquisitely fitted up
with everything a writer or student could require,
and within it a spacious and luxurious bedroom.
When Tom planned the house he had designed
these rooms for his mother, and already, that
evening, there had been a little amiable contest
about them, which, 'possession being nine points
of the law,' had ended, as it was bound to do, in
Mrs. Gregory's triumph.</p>

<p>She went in breathless, and sat down, for
she could not stand. Hoosanee, who was standing,
with arms crossed, as dignified and well-dressed
as usual, awaiting his master's commands,
made her a deep salaam. She pointed
to the inner room, whereupon he retired, closing
the door of communication.</p>

<p>By this time Tom was outside. 'My dear
mother,' he said, noticing, with regret, her pallor
and agitation. 'You mustn't really fatigue yourself
in this way! Come!' kissing her. 'Don't
you know that I want to have my rosy little
mother back as soon as possible? Let me take
you to your room!'</p>

<p>'Presently, dear, presently,' she murmured.
'But shut the door first; I have something to
say to you.'</p>

<p>'Won't to-morrow do?'</p>

<p>'No, Tom. It must be now&mdash;to-night.
While I can, while I dare&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Mother, what do you mean? You are
dreaming.'</p>

<p>She pressed her hand to her brow. 'God
knows I think so myself,' she said. 'Often, very
often, I say, "You are dreaming: there never
was anything so hideous done; and for you to
do it&mdash;you! It is impossible!" and then,' throwing
aside her lace shawl and showing the parcel
on her lap, 'I look at this, and I know that it
is true.'</p>

<p>She stopped, Tom had turned deadly pale.
'Give it to me!' he said. She placed it in his
hands. He sat down and opened it slowly, his
mother watching him with oh! such pitiful eyes.
There it lay before him, just as he had seen it
last&mdash;the legacy of the dead, which he had so
strangely, and, as he believed, so hopelessly
lost.</p>

<p>For a few moments after his discovery he
did not so much as look up. He dared not
even look what he felt.</p>

<p>His silence and abstraction wounded his poor
mother more than words, even stern words, could
have done. Too pained to weep, she sat gazing
out before her with stony eyes. He was noting
meanwhile, with a curious pang, how the very
arrangement of the papers had not changed.
There were the manuscripts in Persian and
Arabic and Hindi, as he had thrown them together
in his boyish wrath and disappointment;
and above them was the sealed roll, unopened
still, that, if he had mustered courage to open
it, would, as he believed, have given him a key
to a hundred mysteries.</p>

<p>Unable to bear any longer the silence and
suspense, Mrs. Gregory crept close to him.
'Tom!' she said.</p>

<p>He looked up. There was reproach in his
eyes, but no anger, and she breathed more
freely. 'Why did you do it, mother?' he said
sorrowfully. 'Could you not have trusted the
dead?'</p>

<p>'Listen to me!' she said. 'Dear, I don't
want to justify myself. I have sinned and I must
bear my punishment. I have borne it, God
knows, through these two awful years. But I
may not have been quite so guilty as you think.
When I saw you go out that night, I had no
thought of robbing you. You left me alone.
Oh! Tom, you shouldn't have done it, you
shouldn't! There was a presence in the house
that night. I felt it as soon as you had gone,
and I fought with it for you. You were mine;
I had brought you up; I had cared for you all
these years; you were everything I had; I
couldn't bear that you should be taken from
me even for a larger life. That was my sin, not
the other. My son, I am telling you a strange
thing, but I give you my word that it is true.
When I left the candle burning in the passage
and went to your room, I was in a trance&mdash;I
must have been, for I have no remembrance of
it, not the least. Often and often since, I have
tried to think myself back into that few minutes,
and I cannot. The first thing I remember is
the cry of fire. I was not in your room then,
I was on the stairs. The girls caught me and
dragged me out. Then, while we stood on the
lawn together, I felt that against my side.'</p>

<p>'You should have given it to me then,
mother.'</p>

<p>'Do I not know it, my son? Have I not
said, so to myself a thousand times? God
knows I should have been saved a host of
troubles if I had. But I could not. Do you see
how it was? I had not taken them. They had
been given to me by a mysterious agency, and
it seemed to me like a sign that you were to be
mine still. Then you went away, and I saw
from your letter, that <i>his</i> life, <i>his</i> ideas, <i>his</i>
people were taking possession of you. At last
came the letter from Lucknow, which told me
only too clearly what I had seemed to know
already, that you belonged to me and to
England no longer. Then I made up my mind
to tell you the secret of your birth, and, if it
should please a merciful God to bring you
home safely, to give you up the papers. Are
you satisfied?'</p>

<p>The question was in response to a softened
look in his face.</p>

<p>'Yes, mother,' he said. 'I am satisfied.
Love blinded you for a time; but justice and
rectitude, which should be stronger even than
love, have opened your eyes.'</p>

<p>'That is a man's view, not a woman's,' she
said, looking up at him with dewy eyes. 'But
good-night. I am tired. Take my advice, and
keep the papers till to-morrow. There is no
danger of your losing them again, and here, you
see, is a fire-proof safe, where you can put them
if you like.'</p>

<p>'Thank you, mother,' said Tom, smiling to
see her look and speak like herself again.
'Good-night! You will sleep well, I am
sure!'</p>

<p>'Well! With you in the house, and that
gone! It will be like Paradise. If only you
knew what I have gone through! But I
mustn't talk of it, now. Good-night, my son.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<blockquote><p>'To my son and successor a word of
warning and counsel.'</p></blockquote>

<p>So ran the opening words of the sealed-up
paper; and those were about all Tom was able
to read that night. After the many fatigues
and excitements of the day his brain was too
heavy to be taxed any further. When
Hoosanee, who had been waiting patiently in
the inner room until the hum of conversation
should cease, receiving no summons from his
master, ventured to open the door between
the rooms, he found him seated before the table,
his arms folded over the open paper, and his
head resting on his arms, fast asleep.</p>

<p>He awoke him, protested with him for his love
of study, and persuaded him to undress and lie
down. So in dreamless sleep the night passed
peacefully away. Of his coming to himself the
next morning I have often heard the rajah speak.
He was perfectly refreshed and strengthened;
but for a few moments he could not stir. As he
lay, the blue of the June sky, flecked with soft
shreds of snow-white vapour, peeped in through
the open window. A tuneful chorus of English
song-birds, linnets and larks and thrushes, filled
the air with throbbing gladness; the familiar
sound of the gardener's scythe, sweeping through
swathes of wet grass, fell dimly upon his ear;
and sweet scents of eglantine and roses and
newly-mown hay saluted his nostrils. Ah!
how delicious they all were&mdash;dream-like sensations
that seemed to be coming to him out of
the tranquil past, and making the fever of these
last two years unsubstantial as a vision!</p>

<p>So, for a few minutes, he mused. Then
Hoosanee looked in, and seeing him awake
brought in tea and his bath, and, in a very short
time he had cast his languor aside, and was
giving himself to his papers.</p>

<p>Those in Persian and Hindi he laid aside for
the present. They were closely written, and,
with all the instruction he had given himself
and the facility he had been able to acquire,
they would, he knew, take him some time to
decipher. The English paper he read at once.
Its full text I am not at liberty to give. I know,
however, that it did not contain the story, which
Tom's mother had given to him, touching his
birth. From first to last, there was nothing to
make him believe that the tie, which, as the
writer asserted, did actually bind him to the
East, was anything but spiritual.</p>

<p>It was written for use in the event, which, as
we know, came about, of the then rajah not
being able personally to make the acquaintance
of his son by adoption. For purposes of his
own it appeared, and in order that his son's
education and training should be entirely
English, he had bound himself not to interfere
with him in any way until he should have
reached years of discretion. Then, if his life
was spared, he would pay a visit to England, and
instruct his adopted son with his own lips regarding
the career that lay before him. For the
rest, it contained instructions concerning Tom's
conduct on his arrival in India, and upon taking
up the government of Gumilcund, which, as the
young rajah recognised with a thrill of pleasure,
agreed in almost every particular with the course
he had instinctively adopted. There were,
besides, dim and uncertain foreshadowings of
spiritual visitations, and dark forebodings of a
time of trial and great terror for the country the
writer loved; the country that, he hoped and
believed, would be loved by his successor; with
admonitions to him to be courageous, bracing
his nerves to receive whatever might come to
him in a manner becoming to a man into whose
hands a sacred trust has been given.</p>

<p>An entreaty that he would be patient, and
not allow himself to fall away into despair if the
good to which they looked as the fruit of their
labours did not come in his time; a recommendation
to train up those who would come after
him to regard themselves as the repositories of
the great trust, any one of whom might be the
Revealer predestined to give to the New World
and the Old the light of the new revelation; a
hope that he would gain sufficient knowledge
of the Eastern languages to read the enclosed
manuscripts, which contained the gist of their
philosophy and the definition of their hope;
with a pathetic farewell, couched in language
which made Tom believe that Byrajee Pirtha
Raj was a Christian at heart&mdash;brought the paper
to a conclusion.</p>

<p>And here, on the threshold of his new life, I
find, to my deep regret, that I must leave him.
The life becomes too complicated; the interests
too numerous; the hopes too lofty and large, to
find room in what will generally be considered
as a work of fiction. Besides, I am not allowed.
All I may venture to say is that he is working
still. A Maharajah in India&mdash;he was given this
title after the mutiny&mdash;and in England a private
gentleman of fortune and distinction, he passes
his life between the two worlds of East and West,
trying to induce that sympathy, that mutual
comprehension, upon which so many of his hopes
for the future depend.</p>

<p>Married now, and with children of his own,
he does not forget his lost love; and indeed, in
the face of his gentle wife, there is an expression
that recalls Grace vividly. It is quite natural,
Aglaia says with a smile, for Grace is often with
her.</p>

<p>And so I bid them, and those who have
followed with me the strange fortunes of the
Rajah's Heir, an affectionate farewell. It is
possible that we may meet again. When the
clouds that still hide the elder continent lift&mdash;and
some of us think that in their darkness we
can discern fissures, through which the azure of
the far-off heaven looks down&mdash;when the Revealer
has spoken, when the long-hoped-for consummation,
the meeting of the nations, has
come; then, if I am still able to write, I will
tell what part Gumilcund and her rulers have
played in the great ever-unfolding drama of the
ages, and how the present has grown out of the
past.</p>
